# Lore Guide

### Overview 

- The Anomaly Project is a multimedia project that includes stories, a web comic, music, and an RPG. Not all of these parts are finished.
- Anomaly Rising and Anomaly Retrograde are the work-in-progress webcomic (separated into two parts) and are the most often referenced. The lore and canon from here is near universal, and applies to the other pieces of media.
- This list will get you familiar with the basics you need to know for the future RPG. After you read this, you can create your own character that fits within the world.
- If you're interested in any of the topics here, the rest of the website is organized to explain everything in greater detail!


### Setting

- Anomaly RPG takes place in an alternate reality of an earth in the future. It features fictional continents, countries, and human races.
- The most frequently referenced countries are Paradiso and Wakane.
- Paradiso is a macro-country with land in multiple continents. Paradiso is rich, aristocratic, fascist, and colonialist. Its primary language is Communia—a direct stand-in for English. Paradiso has taken over the top half of Wakane. Two of its most notable territories are Bellmoral (a stand-in for Britain) and Mainland (a stand-in for the U.S.A.).
- Wakane is a country which upper half is colonized by Paradiso. Its bottom half is what's left of its sovereign land. The primary language is Communia, but the native language of Wakanele is still spoken. There are multiple dialects of Wakanele, two of which are considered the primaries. Wakane contains many displaced refugee descendants called the "Hoabi", who are racial minorities.


### Energy

- All anomalies use energy. Examples include manifestation of physical objects, such as weapons. Energy takes practice. Its use changes dramatically with its user's emotional state. Humans can use limited energy as well.
- Energy is also known as magic, though there isn't much difference beyond terminology. Anomaly operatives use the word energy.
- Paradiso's influence spreads misinformation. Paradiso tries (and fails) to mold energy into a tool for their use, rather than respect the unknowable force it is.
- Every animate being has a soul. You can unlock a soul's true potential, but this process could maim you, scar you for life, or kill you. All anomalies have unlocked souls.


### Anomalies

- An anomaly is an entity that originated from a human, but is supernatural. There are three types of anomalies: anomalous humans, demons, and ghosts. All anomalies directly utilize energy.
- Every anomaly has one extra ability innate to them, that they don't have to practice. Examples from canon include animal magnetism, necromancy, and mind control.
- Anomalous humans are people that unlocked their souls, and live outside humanity's circle. They are the most like humans out of all three anomalies, as they eat normal food, and have physical bodies. They require extra nourishment when compared to humans in order to survive. A ring the color of their sound surrounds their pupil. They risk becoming demons if they lose their sanity.
- Demons are a coping mechanism to defend an individual from harm. They appear as a growth around a soul, spreading and gaining power over time. How a demon appears, interacts with the original person, and behaves can vary. It is up to the player to decide its portrayal. Some common additions to the body are fangs, claws, horns, and tails. They feast on blood and absorbed energy; food isn't enough to sustain them. Demons have physical bodies, and can originate from anomalous humans, ghosts, and regular humans. A ring the color of their sound surrounds their pupil.
- Ghosts wander the world without a body. The ghost's "body" is a projection of the soul, and the individual can chose to live as a floating soul if they please instead. The ghostly body is incorporeal, translucent and tinted the color of their soul. Their soul survives after their physical bodies die. Their eyes contain no color or pupil. Ghosts can possess objects and living beings.


### P.A.S

- While some countries have their own ways they manage supernatural disturbances, Paradiso has an infrastructure to destroy demons. This business-government conglomerate is called the P.A.S. (Paradisian Anomaly Security).
- Anomaly operatives live in groups. After an operative has completed their training, they move to a regular operative group.
- The higher the population of a city, the more operative groups exist in it.
- All anomaly operatives are anomalous humans. They use energy to battle demons and rebels.
- Said energy is used directly (i.e.; explosions, bursts of light, barriers) or concentrated into weapons. Every operative has at least one weapon they can conjure at will.
- There are a handful of roles one can have in the P.A.S.. The most common is the anomaly operative—commonly called AOs and operatives for short. An anomaly operative falls under four categories: a captain, a director, medics, and infantry.
- The captain is the leader of the group. Their word final. Operatives are compulsively obedient to their captain, and have difficulty resisting commands.
- A director is the co-leader, and the assistant of the captain. They carry authority close to a captain's. They're in charge of schedules.
- Medics use healing energy to stitch together wounds and rid operatives of curses. They rarely fight, but some are also infantry members.
- Infantry confronts demons in Paradiso's territory. They chase away and/or neutralize supernatural threats.
- One or two reporters live in every group, depending on its size. Reporters are not considered operatives. They seldom participate in patrol or other operations. Reporters interview group members, documenting their mental state. In addition, reporters are interrogators who suss out suspected rebels.
- None exit the operative life. Operatives notoriously die young, long before they are qualified for remote work outside of group settings. Those who work off-site are rare and extraordinarily lucky.
- All operatives are sent to a re-education facility before they begin training.


### The Liberation Front

- The Liberation Front varies depending on its location, but they all have one common goal; defeat Paradiso. Some sectors focus on the operatives in Paradiso. Without the operatives, Paradiso's land would succumb to an unstoppable rise of demons. Operatives group all who target them as rebels.
- Those in the counteraction militia directly target operatives, and usually are ex-operatives themselves. How they handle their targets depends on their orders, and can range from kidnapping to brutal displays of violence and murder.
