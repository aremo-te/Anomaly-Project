### Bio

Payu is a dedicated freedom fighter. Her personality, goals, and motivation wrap around the concept of justice. Paradiso robbed her people's land, resources, opportunity, and liberty. The macro-nation and corporate conglomerates must die, and Payu will sacrifice anything to stop their tyrrany.

Payu follows her self-imposed moral code without budging. She would never snitch, or harm a child or citizen. Her only goal is dismantling the oppressive regime of Paradiso—not hurting her comrades. Payu protects and defends, and if that means hurting and even killing law enforcement or government officials, she'll do it. Regardless, Payu avoids direct violence whenever she can.

She is energetic, playful, determined, and a little mischievous. Payu loves her position as the rogue hero, and all the over-the-top antics it brings her. Although she hides from the spotlight to avoid getting caught, Payu enjoys attention and being a contributor. Her ridiculous tactics and schemes somehow _always_ work. None give her enough credit until she proves them wrong.

Despite her rebellious nature, Payu would never let a curse word leave her lips. It's dreadful to even consider. Unable to keep up with her racing brain, Payu often rambles and gets lost in her own thought process.

Payu achieves her goals at breakneck speed, and very little can stop her in the road to getting what she wants. She's thrives as a full-time parkouring daredevil and a thrill junkie. As a demon, she is known to throw herself off of buildings, and often uses her ability to fly. Payu has tons of energy. If she can't extinguish her fuel, she bounces off the walls. Payu was born to run, jump, and to live on the bleeding edge. She has a lack of fear response to danger, but is careful to not sustain injuries.

If there's fun, Payu is on site. Her need for stimulation can lead her to weird places. She can't sit down for too long, lest the weight of the world crash over her. Payu avoids excessive introspection, as it shoves her into spiraling despair.

Payu is surrounded by adoring women, making their hearts flutter as she blows them kisses. Payu is a traditional romantic. She falls in love at first sight, writes heartfelt poetry, gives her ladies roses, and showers them in praise. Her confidence and compassion is magnetic.

### Daily Life

Payu is a wayward traveler. While unaligned with specific clans and groups, she assists the local insurgence. She delivers their packages and sneaks between border checks, and collects government intel. Payu enjoys her life as a demon far more than she did as a human. Her demonic shape-shifting abilities provide her the means to blend in and sneak into secured areas. She feeds on positive energies to stay alive, encouraging her to surround herself with happy people.

### Fighting Technique

Payu is an adaptive and tactical fighter, leading her foes on wild goose chases to exhaust them. Payu is slippery and quick on her feet, as well as creative with her battle techniques.

Her limitless imagination and solid magical ability grant her a gigantic plethora of weapons to summon. Payu favors over-the-top weapons over practical ones.

Payu can control and manipulate water, flooding rooms and carrying opponents closer or further away in waves.

She is not incredibly powerful, but her ample artillery, dexterity, and speed more than makes up for her energy deficiency.
