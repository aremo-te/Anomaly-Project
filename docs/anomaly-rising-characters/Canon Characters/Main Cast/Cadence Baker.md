### Summary

Cadence Baker is a Western Wakanean anomalous human working in Judicia as an anomaly operative in the infantry rank. Cadence is rude, defensive, and outright hostile. He preys on short-tempered peers in hope of stirring their anger. Sensitive and easy to offend, Cadence lashes out before thinking. Cadence relies on vices and smokes once a day. He craves love, but believe he doesn't deserve it.


### General Appearance

Cadence stands low as one of the shortest in his group. Borderline sickly, his ribs jut out of his gaunt skin. Bruised dark circles frame his hazel eyes. A golden ring surrounds his pupil, and his iris turns gold when he uses energy. Cadence's matte light-brown skin appears almost yellow. Cadence has two bushy eyebrows and a bad purple dye-job. He wears loose clothing with odd, surreal sentences on them—such as “Milk is good” or “The Earth Is A Cup”. Cadence adores hoodies, hiding his spindly limbs in long sleeves.

### Likes/Hobbies/Talents

Adoring mechanics and engineering, Cadence loves to weld and build robots. Cadence plays video games in his spare time, but frustrates too quickly to complete any.

### Bio

A walking amalgam of bad coping mechanisms and internalized loathing. All conversations with Cadence devolve into arguments. Cadence prods at everyone to uncover their triggers. Once he figures you out, he relentlessly targets your weak spot with heinous words. He doesn't like getting close to people, shoving them away as soon as they get close. If he feels someone growing comfortable around him, he'll act out, procuring a hatred of his company. He sparks rage in others and then goes numb when they fight back, craving the pain. Caught in a never ending cycle of breakdowns, Cadence nurses a drink and smokes to ease his mind.

Cadence can't hold his tongue, delivering backhanded comments or rude thoughts without filter. While not devoid of empathy, Cadence certainly wishes he was, and that he cared less for his peers. He views his relationship with Cijune as a weakness, but is unwilling to let her go. Along with a flourishing crush on Mikko, Cadence found two people to pull his punches with. Cadence self-isolates, but fantasizes about interactions with his group mates—both where he's hurt, and where he's loved.

Bitter and envious of others, Cadence hates everyone, yet longs for intimacy. It's unfair how others don't self-sabotage the way he does. Why can others be happy, but he can't? Cadence shoulders guilt and awaits brutal punishment in whatever form it appears. As far as Cadence is concerned, no one feels pain the way he does—nor deserves to.

### Daily Life

Insecure as the least powerful operative in his group, Cadence trains vigorously for hours to exhaustion. His refusal to eat full meals contributes to his lack of energy. Emotional dysregulation and trauma maintain blistering holes in his soul's fabric. Cadence shares a room with a close friend, Cijune, and refuses to move out. Cherishing the two women who make his life bearable, Cadence treats Cijune and Mikko with respect and care.

Bullying is a means to an end. Cadence views the ghastly words and physical retaliations to him as self-harm. Why cut when you can have people do it for you?

### Fighting Technique

Cadence can't summon weapons long enough to use them. His mind wanders, petrified in his emotions and unable to visualize. Cadence fights through bursts of energy, usually paired with punches and kicks. Neglecting the consequences of his movement, Cadence loses many fights. Cadence is forbidden to work alone and requires supervision during patrol.
