### Summary

Roo Truvade is an anomalous human who lives in Judicia as a vagrant rebel. A no-nonsense businesswoman, Roo gets work done and accomplishes great feats. Roo is respectful, soft-hearted, and a nurturing figure everyone looks up to.

### General Appearance

Roo's naturally textured black hair is dried on stretchers and sits above her tailbone. Her dark brown skin displays many faded scars of her youth. She has a round, plump figure. Her eyes are dark brown. A tan ring surrounds her pupil, and her iris turns tan when she uses energy. Favoring subtle makeup, Roo wears a light nude lipstick.

Roo dons business and business casual clothing over all else, even in leisurely surroundings, she dresses for work. She tries to accessorize with fancy decorative hats whenever she can manage (especially ones with a feather). Her right arm, left lower arm, and left leg are amputated from past egregious injuries.

You can't be a rebel if you're not cute.

### Likes/Hobbies/Talent

Roo relishes a hard day's work. As a child of two businessmen, Roo is partial to overwork, neglecting breaks and leisure time. Despite her upbeat personality, she doesn't know how to have fun. She is uncomfortable when asked to skip a day of work or to go on vacation.

If you force her to answer, rollerskating is her one hobby, which she incorporates into her fighting style and transportation. Also, she adores elegant flower arrangements.

### Bio

Roo is the mentor of most situations she's in. Roo isn't cynical nor rude, but gentle and patient. Her kindness extends to all—even with her enemies, she's cordial and respectful. Roo loathes seeing people upset and refuses to contribute to a bad atmosphere. Utilizing her natural leadership skills, Roo does whatever it takes to unite people, her persuasive words and approachable demeanor aiding her efforts. She delivers stern lectures (when needed), but only out of love. Roo doesn't take well to being talked down to. One of her rare moments of anger is when someone tries to intimidate her or her loved ones. Roo hates bullies.

Out of all the main cast, Roo has been through the most strife. She's seen it all, but is not hardhearted. Extended life experience lends to her empathetic nature. Roo carries no guilt, but she pushes to right her wrongs and to make up for her mistakes. Her brutal and relentless past haunts those who remember her.

Roo is a motherly figure, and loves to spoil others. She has one child, whom she adores and would move mountains for.

Greeting all situations professionally, it's cumbersome to approach Roo outside her perfect presentation. Roo is a die-hard workaholic due to her upbringing. Roo needs to be torn from her work (probably physically) to take a true vacation. Even then, she will find a way to sneak work into her schedule.

Roo grew up in a much different time in Wakane. She didn't have any sort of gender identity (Wakane had no gender binary before Paradiso's occupation) until age 13, and she refuses to identify with the Paradisian's gender binary. Though she accepts being addressed as a woman, she views it as an extension of Paradiso's imperialism.

### Daily Life

Roo moves from town to town, cutting her roots and never dwelling long enough to bring unwanted attention. Crafting new ways to destabilize Paradiso's occupation of Judicia, Roo is an active member of a liberation front in South Wakane. Much of her work consists of information gathering and spying, but she also helps kidnap operatives in Judicia for rehabilitation or blackmail. She has an established family in South Wakane, but is not seen at home often. Roo has a wife and one child.

### Fighting Technique

Roo is the most skilled fighter of the main cast. Period.

Her skills in mixed martial arts and ability to pick up new skills in the blink of the eye add to her immense talent on the battlefield. Roo is nothing if not adaptable. With no go-to techniques or style, Roo performs whatever is required to accomplish a task. While Roo is known for her merciless bloodshed in the past, she now fights to subdue, not to kill. Roo chooses non-lethal action, even when dealing with the worst humanity has to offer.
Roo's biggest talents are as a captain and as a leader, preferring recognition for diplomacy and kindness as opposed to her raw strength.
