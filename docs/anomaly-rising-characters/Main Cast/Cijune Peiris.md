### Personality

Cijune is proactive, not reactive. She takes the time to think before she speaks, and rarely, if ever, blurts out words she regrets. If she speaks, she means it. Drama annoys her; it's unsatisfying to stoke the flames, so she avoids arguments. Cijune does not start fights, but ends them when necessary.

She utilizes her wits to weasel out of sticky situations. In the past and present, Cijune's intelligence and quick-thinking saves her life and the lives of others. Cijune takes great pride in her looks, and her confidence in her own beauty stuns everyone around her with awe. She doesn't waste time with self-hate or self-loathing, but focuses on self-improvement.

Cijune's fun-loving personality lands her in disagreeable circumstances. Despite her accurate and insightful judgement calls for her friends, when Cijune is manic, she can't weigh her own actions. Though she can be resistant to help, she always appreciates being pulled out of a messy situation she conjured on accident, and values her friends' input.

Compulsions prod at Cijune's psyche, and she struggles to control the anxiety-riddled thoughts. One is the compulsion to give homemade outfits to her friends. She begs others to take her gifts, paranoid of bad events the rejection could incite. Cijune's fear of abandonment lends to her in friendships with detrimental people (even when she voices her anger towards them.) Her nurturing and caring soul marks her as a target for manipulation.

With almighty emotions encompassing her like a swirling whirlpool, Cijune wears her heart on her sleeve. A story with just a drop of sorrow can wring tears out of Cijune, along with her guilty pleasure for sappy romance novels and poetry. She absorbs feelings like a sponge.

Fighting is Cijune's weakest attribute. Cijune's intrinsic fear of physical altercation bars her from infantry work. She is unable to summon weapons or train for fighting, as it scares her to the core. If you attempt to fight her, she will cry and distrust you until the day you die. Despite her inner cowardice, Cijune refuses to back down from a fight on principle.

Cijune is a flirt with the men, but doesn't take their romantic feelings seriously, nor does she see long-term commitment as a goal. Later on, Cijune realizes she was never attracted to men, and instead, fosters healthy relationships with women.

### Daily Life

Cijune focuses each week on a new personal goal. While achieving her goals, her standards are high, and she sometimes falls short and disappoints herself. Her magic studies are specific to healing and conjuring tools to aid with healing. She doesn't enjoy studying as much as she enjoys the process of trying out a new healing spell and seeing what works and what doesn't. She's very much a hands-on type of learner, and embraces this.

Cijune resents solitude, requiring accompaniment 80% of the time. Before acquiring a partner in the medical wing, Cijune worked by her lonesome with no one to bounce ideas off of. Cijune shares a room with Cadence, and is one of the few group mates to room with another member full time. Time spent with others is where she shines the best, and does the best work.

Cijune is drawn to astrology and astronomy. Whenever the cloud cover leaves night skies clear, she explores the ether with a telescope.
