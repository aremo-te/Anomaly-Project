### Summary

Ayasa Lnu is a Wakanean anomalous human working in Judicia as an anomaly operative in the infantry rank. He is a bookworm and cold know-it-all with a sharp temper. While riddled with guilt and resentment, Ayasa seems determined to stew in his unchanging misery.

### General Appearance

Ayasa's sharp gaze and permanent scowl lashes deep into all that look upon him. His skinny frame and lean, thin muscles are lithe and agile. Ayasa wears black framed glasses for his low vision. Upon close inspection, scars litter his brown skin. Ayasa favors a mix of business casual and sultry feminine outfits. A purple ring surrounds his pupil, and his iris turns purple when he uses energy.

### Likes/Hobbies/Talents

Ayasa studies magic with religious zealotry and devotion. He grows his own herbs, collects rocks, creates potions, and cultivates original spells. A deep affinity for learning and written media sparked his passion for collecting and refurbishing books. His favorite hobby is removing curses from old texts.

### Bio

Ayasa is a wall of disillusionment and haughty, brazen grandiosity. With carefully constructed sentences, verbosely complex words, and omitted contractions, Ayasa speaks to impress. The more ornate and intelligent he sounds, the better satiated his ego. He is irritable, distrustful, and skeptical to the point of exasperation. Ayasa wears his anger on his sleeve, responding to negativity with a packed array of nonverbals.

He hyperfocuses on individual contingencies, and overanalyzes details that end up meaningless—tangling himself in his own conspiracy theories immersed in paranoia.

Ayasa lashes out when slighted. If inclined, he will eviscerate your psyche with reckless regard. He is vocal, and refuses compromise in intellectual challenges or squabbles. No status sits above Ayasa's potential wrath. Authority and established hierarchy enrage Ayasa, as he doesn't take kindly to orders without explanation. Respect is earned, not obligated. While Ayasa touts his skills of perception, any bad actor can bait him with bad-faith arguments and he is easily tricked. Many consider his speech condescending.

Despite his dogmatic approach to daily life, Ayasa approaches magic with a playful, childlike curiosity, encouraged to experiment and toy with his expectations. Determined to snuff out misinformation, Ayasa clamors against anyone that claims “energy” is a fitting replacement word for magic. Magic softens Ayasa's hardened resolve—a beautiful, personal, and cherished portion of Ayasa's life he shares with good company. He brims with excitement when discussing magic.

Ayasa is not so snooty as to hate a fun time, especially if it means learning something new.

Ayasa loathes his intellectual inadequacies, and as a result, studies compulsively—wracked with imposter syndrome, hiding behind his constructed quagmire of a personality and cold, callous language. He is compassionate and empathetic, though these qualities lie beyond his obvious front. Ayasa is far from the worst member of Group #113, as he shows kindness for others and has a sense of humor—sarcastic or black when alone, but in the company of Kemui, Ayasa mirrors her deadpan absurdist comedy.

Frequent visual hallucinations of dark figures and shadows distress his eyesight, and his vision blanks from stress. Ayasa treats these like simple nuisances, finding them more annoying than anything else.

### Daily Life

Ayasa and Kemui thrive together, moving as one unit. Whatever one is doing, the other trails close by. Ayasa indulges whatever Kemui takes interest in this week, encouraging her to do her best. Ayasa crams magical practice into his spare time. If not found with Kemui or by his cauldron, Ayasa's nose is stuck in a book.

Ayasa regards four members of the group with disdain, namely Noah, Aure, Celestius, and Mikiya.

Ayasa's complicated feelings for Mikiya alienates them from mutual understanding, which compiles into mounting rage Ayasa cannot justify. Their storied history, Ayasa and Mikiya's fleeting childhood romance, is uncomfortable for Ayasa. He is torn between nostalgia for the fabricated simplicity of the Mikiya from his childhood, and the resentment of a Mikiya he can't recognize. Ayasa sees the dark side of Mikiya that had formed in Ayasa's absence. He dehumanizes and simplifies Mikiya into an inhuman monster. He loathes that Mikiya, the one he trusted, is a captain and stands for everything Ayasa hates.

Mikiya reminds Ayasa of how he used to behave before he became a rebel, and it's misdirected self-loathing. He loves, hates, mourns Mikiya, and wishes him dead.

### Fighting Technique

The battlefield suits Ayasa's tactical skills. Ayasa views fights through a puzzle-solving lens, as much of a clash of swords as it is an art form. His weapons are extensions of himself, harmonized, with equal weight distributed to both hands. Ayasa's kills are clinical and detached. This differs from his rage triggers within his group, which are fleeting and an intimidation tactic.

If thrown into battle without time to plan, Ayasa will perform marginally worse.
