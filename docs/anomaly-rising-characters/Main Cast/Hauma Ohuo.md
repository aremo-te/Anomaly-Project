### Bio

Hauma is laid-back, nonchalant, and doesn't take himself too seriously. He is responsible, accepting culpability of his group as his own and apologizing on behalf of others throughout his tenure.

Hauma doesn’t speak formally in most situations. Jokes and work blend together well, but Hauma knows when to be serious and when to loosen up. He balances the line perfectly, attentive to his word choice and situational surroundings. Hauma shortens everyone’s names in conversations—professional or not. This is due to his upbringing in southeast Wakane, where name conventions and honorifics serve different functions. He uses full first names in serious or private, intimate situations. If he uses your first and surname together, he’s winding up to beat you to a pulp.

While everyone else loses their minds, Hauma is cool and calm. He fills his group's mess hall with laughter, engaging everyone in open, jovial discourse. Sensing a brewing argument a mile away, Hauma is the very first one to chime in and halt a quarrel in its tracks before it begins. He keeps the unwieldy group running smoothly. Hauma bonds deeply with his group—a big sibling, a great friend, and a reliable romantic partner. Hauma's presence is a joy to many. With dozens looking up to him as inspirational, the adoration humbles Hauma as much as it unnerves him.

Dancing around your goals furthers you from achievement—thus, Hauma tackles all situations head-on, relentless once determined. There's no time for subtlety when lives are at stake, and any leader worth their spit is hasty and flexible. Hauma bends his morals in order to suit dire circumstance, as long as it brings his group home alive at the end of a hard day. With nothing to prove and no hill worth dying on to preserve his ego, Hauma backs down from pointless, risky, and stupid challenges. As long as he does his job, Hauma cares little how people regard him. Hauma lacks personal embarrassment. He wears what he wants, speaks how he likes, and has no shame in his interests.

As a professional, Hauma is stern and strict, betraying the lax personality his subordinates expect. Hauma is no tyrant, nor unreasonable, but running a tight ship requires dirtying his hands. All are necessary sacrifices for the future. Hauma receives no joy from lying, yelling at others, nor scaring them into submission. Hauma's stubborn, bold, and blunt nature strengthens his commands and tough resolve.

The straight man role is one Hauma didn't expect to slot into. Growing up, he was the eccentric and oddball, accidentally a spectacle outside his volition. But his antics are tame compared to the wild mania and weird activities of the other group mates. Someone has to wrangle in everyone's violent, angry, irrational, and idiotic tendencies. Almost no one in his group has as much formal group training as him, so his silliness has hard limits.

Hauma conceals fear of early demise; death spawns many of his burgeoning terrors. Hauma doesn’t understand death, unable to wrap his head around what it will feel like or what might happen after. His previous dances twirling the edge of death have left him with incessant trepidation.

Hauma craves reassurance, even if it's a lie, even if it harms him in the end. Hauma ignores his own egregious actions and the actions of those he loves in self-preservation. It's comfortable and easier that way.

Disguising his anger towards others and holding back his true thoughts, Hauma is a ticking bomb of rage on his last inch of fuse.

### Daily Life

Hauma indulges in creature comforts—warm food, a soft bed, comfortable clothes, and a recognizable home to return to. Favoring routine over surprises, Hauma wants a schedule that remains more-or-less consistent and predictable.

Director's work is information-heavy, and he spends 1/3rd of his shift collecting data and creating documents. Both Hauma and Mikiya construct task forces, but Hauma is in charge of group scheduling. Consequently, the group directs their time slot rage to Hauma. Unable to please everyone, and brimming with spite, Hauma uses bad schedules as a form of punishment. A looming threat to anyone who tries to stir trouble—keep fucking around, and your schedule will be garbage.

Hauma rests with extra-long naps on his days off. In exchange for group harmony, Hauma shoulders a brutal shift schedule due to operative shortages in return for less sleep. When more than half-awake, he’ll spend time with Mikiya, or with his other friends. Free from monogamous restrictions, Hauma enjoys flings and other relationships that toe the line between friend and lover. Regardless, he returns to Mikiya as his #1.

### Fighting Technique

Hauma fights best with instruction and structure, executing orders given to him with precision. In addition, Hauma leads operations with an iron fist, doling out firm commands and destroying dissent. In battle, Hauma is patient and observant, awaiting the moment to strike. Favoring barriers and melee attacks, Hauma avoids frequent weapon usage, and prefers using his hands to punch and tear through enemies. Water is a useful resource to him, harnessing the innate power to bend massive waves to his will. His body is built to take a punch and to dish out heavy damage, dampened by his low swiftness. What Hauma lacks in speed and raw energy power, he makes up for in flawless defense.
