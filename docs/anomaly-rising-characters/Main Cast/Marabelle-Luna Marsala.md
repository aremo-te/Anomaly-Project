### Summary

She is a fun-loving, manipulative troublemaker, and thrives off of chaos. While appearing innocent upon first glance, malice boils under her surface. ML's natural charm draws her peers in, and her sinister vibes simultaneously drive them away. Vengeful in nature, no one can cross ML without suffering.

She's the prom queen. Bow down.

### General Appearance

ML's wavy blonde hair rests below her narrow shoulders. Her light brown eyes reflect golden bronze in the sun. A dark brown ring surrounds her pupil, and her iris turns dark brown when she uses energy. She seems doll-like in stature, but hidden under her clothing are carved, sturdy muscles. Most of her features have a “delicate” quality to them. ML adores y2k couture and mcbling fashion.

### Likes/Hobbies/Talent

ML lives half her life on social media as the #2 most followed account on ChatMap, touting clout as a trendsetter as well as an entertaining personality.

### Bio

ML is here to have fun and get exactly what she wants.

ML projects confidence from her every orifice. Glossing over details and consequences, ML jumps into action without a moment's hesitance. ML restrains herself if there's something to be gained. She bites her tongue if she knows, in the long run, she will reap the harvest she sows. If there's no reason to hold back, she won’t pull her punches.

ML feeds off envy of her talents and looks, exploiting every moment to show off or one-up a potential challenger.

Free of shackles, ML lives as she pleases. If she wants something, she’ll bend and break any rule or person to accomplish her goals. Nothing is sacred; she will betray friends, family, and “loved ones” to satiate her desires and ego. Self-centered and callous, ML believes herself devoid of romantic inclinations. Life is a nonstop party, and she has no reason to grind her fun to a halt to care for others feelings.

Her favorite display of violence is arson, starting random fires if the feeling stirs within her. ML is not above stealing, manipulating, maiming, or murdering people for her own gain. She is a sadist, and fancies herself a villain. Her soft voice allures all within earshot. She can sow seeds of discord into conversations, with no one aware of her intentions.

ML envisions herself topping the hierarchy, fantasizing of her power and influence. Authorities view her in a much different way than her own peers, as ML kisses up to her captains and directors.

Despite all her eccentricities and sadistic behavior, ML blends into her group. She’s fairly composed—her outbursts short-lived and rare. The easiest way to enrage ML is to snitch on her. She loathes snitches, and has followed through on her threats to get even. Physically or emotionally, one way or another, ML has her revenge as the empress of petty. Most often you won’t see her fuming. Rather, you will see small dishes of vengeance served on the down-low, delivered with a wink and a smile. ML funnels her anger into vindication, loving to prove others wrong, or ruining their lives.

Trauma is a given in groups, and ML, like all her peers, has trauma by the boatload she refuses to address. To ML, trauma is a badge of honor. She views witnessing death, her involvement in awful fights, and how many times she’s almost died as notches in her belt. ML doesn’t realize her impulsive actions are trauma coping mechanisms. Viewing herself as above humanity, as some sort of agent of chaos or a supernatural force, ML neglects her own humanity.

ML flirts with anyone of any gender. She loves to butter people up and leave them wanting more.

### Daily Life

ML works when she needs to and no more. Her free time is not often spent with her group. She escapes into the city, searching for trouble and entertainment. She frequently stirs up chaos with crime syndicates and drug dealers. Substance abuse is a regular part of ML’s life, with cocaine as her drug of choice.

She spends time with her group to build reputation, pantomiming participation to score points. Interested in Mikko and Celestius in particular, ML enjoys toying with them. Her primary fixation lies with Mikko, who, in turn, is fascinated with ML. ML strings along Mikko in her romps through the city.

Her need to cause chaos sparked an interest in dark magic and curses. She has basic knowledge on this, and can be seen studying a book when plotting a greater act of revenge on someone.

Germophobic and clean-obsessed, ML carries hand sanitizer on herself at all times and avoids unsanitary things.

### Fighting Style

Her life as an operative is packed with violence. ML is a messy killer, leaving a gruesome scene behind. Her fighting style is relentless and ruthless, showing no restraint during a fight. Relying on bombast, ML blindsides everyone with her force of power. ML winds up and hits slow, yet heavy and hard, minding little to self-defense.
