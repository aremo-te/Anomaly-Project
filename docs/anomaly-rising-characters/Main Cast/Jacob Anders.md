### Summary

Jacob Anders is an anomalous human working in Judicia as an anomaly operative medic. Her off-kilter personality, politeness, and her slow speech make her unique among her peers. It's sleepy time, baby!

### General Appearance

Jacob's fluffy white hair sits around her ears, in her eyes, and above the nape of her neck. She has brown skin, and permanent dark circles under her eyes. She rarely sits or stands straight, and is usually seen slumped over. A faint, darkened scar lives under her right eye. A red ring surrounds her pupil, and her iris turns red when she uses energy.

Jacob favors warm, comfortable clothes, wearing cozy outfits regardless of the weather. Somehow, she seems incapable of sweating, no matter how sweltering the heat. She loves knitted sweaters and cardigans, her favorite piece of clothing being a turtleneck.

Jacob fears appearing intimidating or strange. To combat this, she tries adding cute accessories to her outfits like bows, hair clips, and pins.

### Likes/Hobbies/Talents

Jacob enjoys tabletop games/RPGs, computer programming, and tending to her bonsai garden. Utilizing her programming skills, Jacob coded a pet sim called "Anomagacha", which has gained notoriety in the app store.

She also loves visiting abandoned buildings and areas, especially abandoned theme parks.

### Bio

Jacob is excessively polite, addressing everyone with high ranking honorifics, and apologizing for all inconveniences (even if she doesn't cause them.) Jacob bows her head when greeting others. She goes out of her way to avoid burdening people, even if it means shouldering more than she can handle. Jacob is proper, even to those who anger her. She rarely stoops to harshness, but when she does, she frames them within her usual polite speech (EX: She calmly tells Randy to "please choke" when he harasses her.). Indebted to anyone kind to her, Jacob gifts small presents and acts of kindness in return for everything.

Jacob speaks in a soft, low voice. She spreads her sentences out, and can often lose her track of own words. She comes off as an air-head to some, and trying to keep up a conversation when she's tired can be nearly impossible. Wandering off into odd territory when she speaks, Jacob casually brings up dark subjects if they happen to be on her mind. She is incapable of lying and will go silent rather than tell a fib.

Jacob doesn't know her own strength. As an anomaly who eats plenty of full meals, she breaks household objects with ease, shattering plates and glasses in her grip. When surprised, she clenches whatever is in her hand. While her strength surges don't hurt other anomalies, she damages humans if she's not careful. Jacob once hugged a human too hard, breaking three of their ribs and part of their spine—to whom she apologized to and bawled profusely at.

Perpetually curious about all things, Jacob is a cat that wanders off beyond boundaries. While not nosy, Jacob lands herself in bad situations due to her desires to know secrets.

Though her expressions are muted, Jacob isn't deadpan or hesitant to express feelings. She openly weeps when upset, and covers her face with her turtleneck when embarrassed.

Jacob isn't thrilled to be alive, with suicide plaguing her mind every day. Though not proactively seeking death, she will casually mention her suicidal ideation when the subject rises. Jacob is depressive and quiet, falling asleep in any situation on any surface. Despite all of Jacob's intense negative emotions, she isn't mean spirited to anyone, and always means well.

### Daily Life

In the past, Jacob was in the infantry. She hated her role, but tried her best. Now, she is a medic, and the work suits her well.

Jacob builds computers and makes useless apps in her spare time (EX: the annoying volume sliders competition on Reddit.) She sprinkles kaomoji into her programming notes. Jacob enjoys discovering flaws and exploits, and anonymously alerts websites to glitches they should patch.

Jacob's habit of falling asleep and forgetfulness is eased by her friends. Typically, Mikiya, Mikko, Len, Sokemui, and Heavenly are the ones carrying Jacob to bed or reminding her to eat.

### Fighting Technique

Jacob is passive in a majority of her battles. She favors her primary weapon, and creates shields for her allies. She's of average skill in all avenues.

If you somehow manage to enrage Jacob (a hard task to accomplish), there is no saving you.
