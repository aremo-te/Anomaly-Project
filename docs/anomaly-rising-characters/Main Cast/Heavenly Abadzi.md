### Bio

Heavenly carries the mindset of one in luxury, enjoying each day of life in domestic bliss. They sway with the motions, unbothered by the chaos and anguish of everyday operative life. Heavenly rarely, if ever, complains. Leaving their personal touch on their peers, Heavenly assigns group members multiple adorably-trite and silly nicknames.

Devoid of cynicism and malice, Heavenly suppresses annoyance and anger towards everyone. Bubbly, jovial, and talkative, Heavenly develops friendships with practiced ease. Heavenly longs for harmony and peace and seems to forgive without reservation.

Their frustration will redirect to themself, even if whatever happened was not their fault. Over time, they've forgotten that not everyone will enjoy their company or like them around. They will attempt again and again to make friends with someone unwilling, and is disappointed when unsuccessful. Heavenly has difficultly with voicing the word “no”, and it can plunge them into uncomfortable situations.

Heavenly is a shoulder to cry on, but they struggle delivering concrete advice, defaulting to shallow positive platitudes to soothe friends.

Heavenly cracks under heavy pressure— twitching, restlessly wringing their hands, and drumming their heels on the ground. Their brain scatters, reducing Heavenly to a babbling, hysterical mess— their hastened words accompanied by bloodshot eyes and a flinching smile.

Despite their soft nature, Heavenly is deadly, and not to be underestimated.

A beleaguered and bitter shadow trails behind Heavenly's gentle facade. Heavenly's holy, ethereal aesthetic extends beyond ornamental, and directly informs their condition. Their constructed personality centers on warped perceptions of puritan virtue—the more subjugation they experience, the more they suffer and grovel, the further Heavenly escalades to spiritual salvation. Believing themself an honorable and principled individual, Heavenly represses their resentment, smoothing out their flaws with a benevolent grin.

Heavenly believes themself owed favor due to their emotional and physical sacrifices, self-martyring to the point of farce. While Heavenly refuses to admit the truth, Heavenly silently loathes their enemies and friends alike, showing affection with the conviction that rewards await them later. Lacking self-awareness, Heavenly is emotionally stunted, playing mind games and expecting others to intuit their true emotions.

Heavenly worships authority and looks up to the faceless entities that rule over them.

### Daily Life

Heavenly spends their leisure days speaking with their friends, brewing iced coffee, and knitting. They avoid spoiling casual conversation with work talk. Overseeing group events and relations, Heavenly scours the internet and downtown streets for potential meetup ideas.

Heavenly adores succulents, tending to them with the same care as a parent with children. Spread throughout Heavenly's living quarters sits ornate plant pots and various music boxes. An undercover and zealous history buff, Heavenly's special interest lies in the macabre yesteryear of magic, pouring over the nasty details of “evil magic” and ritual sacrifice.

Their ability to absorb energy from living and non-living entities around bypasses the requirement to indulge in copious meals. Lending their calming aura to friends, Heavenly's peers invite them to sleepovers for a good night's rest.

### Fighting Technique

Operatives ridicule and mock Heavenly's rifle, but their gargantuan kill count and showmanship dazzles their cult-like social media followers. Inspired by dance and color guard, Heavenly's artistic prowess surfaces in close combat. They glide and maneuver throughout the battlefield as if on ice skates. Heavenly maps out each careful step to their benefit, turning every close-range battle into an elegant ballet.

Despite that, far and medium range is where Heavenly shines the most as an imposing sharpshooter.
