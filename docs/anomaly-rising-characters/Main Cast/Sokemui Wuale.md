### Summary

Sokemui Wuale is an anomalous human working in Judicia as an anomaly operative in the infantry rank. In contrast to her violent past, Sokemui treats her peers with respect and resolves conflicts with peace. While intimidating in her general demeanor, she is thoughtful, humorous, and grateful for her friends.

### General Appearance

Sokemui towers above her group mates with hardened muscles and proud posture. She enjoys wearing a mix of minimalist, grunge, casual, and street wear, though she usually dresses masculine no matter the style. Her short hair changes colors from week to week, ranging from muted brown to vibrant blue. Silvered scars tatter her lightly tanned skin. An orange ring surrounds her pupil, and her iris turns orange when she uses energy.

### Likes/Hobbies/Talents

Sokemui enjoys photography, journaling, and information collecting through vigorous research. She dances, but rarely does someone prompt her to show off her talent.

Sokemui's cardinal talent is neutralizing and/or murdering any target in any situation—a skill Sokemui holds in contempt and low regard.

### Bio

The master of comedic timing and punchlines, Sokemui's jokes border on lethal. Sokemui's sharp memory clings to any information she absorbs, recalling facts and events from eons ago with ease. She's also the best listener in the group, and lends an ear to anyone needing to vent. Sokemui gives pointed and accurate feedback—blunt but not cruel. As the residential Mom Friend of the group, Sokemui sees maintaining peace and harmony as a personal responsibility, intervening in physical altercations without a second though.

Sokemui speaks in succinct, pithy sentences. When asked to expand on her thoughts, she ofttimes obliges. Sokemui thinks before she acts to procure her desired outcome. Nothing about Sokemui is spontaneous. One of her biggest values is healthy relationships. Sokemui cares about her fiancé and friends more than she does for herself.

Forgiving and mild, Sokemui sees beyond flaws and past mistakes, accepting a person as they are—but no one draws harder lines in the sand when they're fed up than her. If Sokemui wants you dead, that would have already happened.

Sokemui approaches matters with a flat expression—excluding embarrassing subjects. Compliments and affection curry unfamiliar emotions she's not prepared to handle. Sokemui devolves into a stuttering, flushed mess when shown a smidgen of adoration. Though restrained in expression, Sokemui smiles the most to Ayasa (especially when intoxicated.)

### Daily Life

Sokemui enjoys her downtime. Her job is not her identity, nor a source of joy.

Thriving on new experiences, Sokemui obliges virtually every invitation to spend time with people. Like an information sponge, Sokemui absorbs expertise and hobbies from her friends. Sokemui learns new skills from peers, then develops them further in her personal time. Learning and experimenting replaced her need to train and battle to exhaustion—her violent nature laid to rest while her creativity flourishes.

When at work, Sokemui relaxes, daydreaming on patrol. Sokemui spends downtime—such as walking between assignments—compartmentalizing her copious thoughts and recollections. Uninterested in grievous harm or murder of her opponents, Sokemui pacifies advisories, to the mounting irritation of her peers.

### Fighting Technique

Sokemui is one of the best operatives in the game, finessing her way through battle with unmatched talent. Despite her deadly skill set, Sokemui is a pacifist who uses her accomplished techniques in self-defense.

What Sokemui lacks in energy capacity, she makes up for this in pure skill. At one time, her adaptability to any environment and callous disregard for life made her unstoppable—pitilessly eradicating enemies in gory, ostentatious brutality. Her previous status as an up-and-coming captain trainee brings her shame, and she refuses to glorify her past actions.
