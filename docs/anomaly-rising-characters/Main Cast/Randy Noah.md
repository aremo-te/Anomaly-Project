### Summary

*Randall Noah Paul* (usually referred to as *Noah* or *Randy*) is an anomalous human working in Judicia as an anomaly operative in the infantry rank. An arrogant and grating presence, Noah is devoid of sympathy and works to undermine his peers' achievements. Noah is both power-hungry and too lethargic to achieve his goals. He feels entitled to attention and notoriety.


### General Appearance

Bad.

Stark pale skin stretches over his average build with little sign of life below it. His hair is dyed a dark blue, his light brown roots surfacing near his thinning part. Greasy and reeking of caked-on body spray, Noah regards proper hygiene with disgust. A light blue ring surrounds his pupil, and his iris turns light blue when he uses energy.

Who cares what his eye color is. Let's move on.

### Likes/Hobbies/Talents

Noah enjoys Mainland football and expanding his useless gun collection.

### Bio 

Do we really have to do this? We can just skip him.

Noah envisions himself a mysterious master manipulator—a pragmatic genius underdog who will rise in ranks. He fantasizes about ruling over people with an iron-fist. Headstrong in nature, Noah harms others with ill-thought-out plans and hair-brain schemes. Unable to take criticism or self reflect, Noah blames periphery details and dodges responsibility. His victim complex shines brightest when his flagrant disregard for life and his privilege in society are spotlighted by his peers.

Noah filters his opinions for situations he can milk for benefits; otherwise, he drones on about his unfortunate life in endless rants, searching for any opportunity to whine. His problems are always more important, and far more painful than yours. Distanced from emotional reality, Noah berates his sentimental, thoughtful, and nuanced peers. Noah enjoys jokes that push the boundary of acceptable behavior. Masking his bigotry as humor, Noah speaks over others and interrupts sentences with his crude humor.

Certain he's the smartest in any room he occupies, Noah avoids educating himself further. He wants to comprehend others' minds and manipulate them to perform his bidding, but his fundamental incurious and anti-intellectual habits bar him from true understanding. Unintentionally isolating himself from others, Noah views all from a warped, misanthropic perspective, falsely concluding on others' motivations and feelings while refusing to learn better.

Noah savors when people fear or don't understand him, bolstering his lone-wolf outlook on himself. Fancying himself an alpha male, Noah asserts his dominance, flexing in situations where it's especially detrimental. He preys on weaker people, picking fights he's guaranteed success in.

Noah prefers the name "Noah" rather than "Randy/Randall", as this reminds him of his haunting, toxic childhood.

### Daily Life

Noah is the run-of-the-mill infantry. He works full-time, but slacks off as much as he can get away with. Performing mediocrely and leaving loose ends at every mission, Noah is always partnered with a more powerful member of the group. As much as Noah likes to beat his chest and tout his skills, he fails everyone's reduced expectations.

In his spare time, Noah goes to sports games and gun shows. Noah adores guns—though an AO's primary weapon should never be a projectile, Noah's is, defending his stance in face of contrary evidence. He thinks it's a unique personality trait.

It's not.

### Fighting Technique

Stealthy. Or, at least, he wishes he is. Noah prefers to sneak up on enemies and to shoot them in the head, or to land a shot from far away. This rarely goes well, as most of his enemies dodge his initial attack, confronting him immediately afterwards. Noah's energy barriers are weak, but offer him a means of escape as he's attacked. Stealing kills from his patrolling partner in the last moment, Noah takes all the credit if he landed the final blow, even if he performed nothing of worth.
