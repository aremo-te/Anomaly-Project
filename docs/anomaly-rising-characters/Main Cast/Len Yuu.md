### Personality

Len has little filter of their personality in casual settings. Those around them eventually adapt to not take their irritability seriously, unless the situation itself is dire. One way to tell if they're relaxed is if they're roasting others. Len does not take genuine anger out on anyone who doesn’t deserve it. They're not above complaining and voicing concerns, as well as dishing out harsh honesty when no one else can. Len uses their anger for comedy. This becomes an issue when people unfamiliar with them assume their banter with friends are bitter insults. Len's “rage” in these situations are overdramatic and not the least bit intimidating. They're not above laughing at their friend's lesser misfortunes. If someone requests that Len not tease them, Len apologizes and backs down, quick to say “sorry” in all situations.

"Opinionated" is an understatement. Len has hard beliefs in anything from war to fruit. It's yet another part of Len's friendships to present their opinions and commence a roasting session. Len doesn't mind being made fun of, as long as they can fire back. They love a good laugh. Though, Len's opinions on social justice cannot be shaken or changed, and they will nullify outrageous dissenting arguments.

In polite conversation, Len is formal and mild. This side of Len is very business-like compared to the constantly theatrical cursing nitpicker everyone understands. Of course, Len can't keep it all hidden. A curse or two might slip into a formal discourse, or signs of their temper might flare in an instant reaction upon hearing an especially egregious opinion. After they clear their throat, Len returns to character.

Stubbornness is a virtue. Len will not be told to take something less seriously or to stop working, and is insulted that you'd ask them to! If Len wants to do you a favor, nothing will change their mind. In contrast, Len mellows with a few reasonable words. While they annoy easily, they never take it out on other people, or on anyone who doesn't deserve it. If Len dislikes you, they will not waste time on you, ignoring your existence and ghosting you into oblivion.

No one on earth loves their friends more than Len does. Len would throw down their own life for their peers. Len might act grumpy when you ask them for help, but always end up helping.

Secretly a swooning gushy romantic, Len dreams of someone sweeping them off their feet, reading poetry, and bestowing flowers. Len loathes appearing needy, but they yearn for the affection they've seen in movies and TV.

Genuine physical aggression directed towards Len outside the battlefield makes them freeze up and cry. They trust their friends, and one of their biggest fears is being betrayed in a random act of violence.

### Daily Life

Len's free time is steeped in violin and dance as escape from the dregs of daily life. They enjoy dancing with others and testing out new choreography. Len doesn't know how to do things that aren't work. Their hobbies become labor, aiming for perfection. They make everything into a stressful job; from cooking to cleaning to dancing. If they're not doing their best, they feel like they have failed. They don't take extra hours of field group work (patrol), but they never allow themself a moment of reprise or genuine relaxation. It's always time to move to the next thing.

Len wakes up at 5am every day without fail. They are paranoid that if they don't start the day early, they'll waste precious time.

On an almost daily basis, Len changes their pronouns. They are frequently asked what their pronoun of the day is, even amidst tense arguments.

  <div>
Len houses a demon in their body. They are terrified to know what would happen to them if this was revealed, as their profession is to slay demons. The demon inside them is docile, and feeds on Len's energies. They have not attempted to take control of Len without permission, and merely gives Len bitchy commentary on their choices in daily life. Len feels great pity for the bored demon. They argue like siblings, the demon that fragmented from Len's younger self being the less mature of the two.

### Fighting Technique

In battle, Len uses their environment to their advantage. They often throw debris and environmental hazards as distraction or for damage. In addition, they climb walls, trees, or other objects in the area. Anyone partnered with Len for a battle is used as a launching pad or as a steppingstone to get to higher areas. Len is great for throwing, akin to a human bomb. They’re all about teamwork, and quick thinking. Battles are like improv!

Their weapon appears unwieldy next to them: a scythe that towers two feet longer than their body. Yet, Len maneuvers the weapon with the grace of those with dedicated years of honed skill. As if the weapon is weightless, Len can twirl the large weapon in one hand without breaking their stride.

Len, in terms of raw energy output, is well beyond most of their peers. They generate tons of energy and blow their enemies away; literally. Unfortunately, Len has the lowest stamina due to compromised lung capacity. They tire quickly.
