### Summary

*Celestius Kastillo* is an anomalous human working in Judicia as an internal group affairs reporter. A fierce frigid  aura permeating the air, Celestius holds her head high, her unblinking eyes lurking at every corner. Celestius is harsh, callous, sarcastic, and lavishes in the power she holds over her group's heads.

### General Appearance

Celestius's angular face frames drooping green eyes. A black circle surrounds her pupil, and her iris turns black when she uses energy. Her skin is a light pink, layered in stark white foundation (as is fashionable in Mainland). Celestius paints on heavy makeup, and layers her mascara and eyeshadow black. Her eyebrows are shaven to small dots. Celestius stands tall, her spindly limbs a hair too skinny and long.

All social events and gatherings call for black clothing. Even when conforming to the fashion standards of a specific situation, she will never wear flashy colors. She favors gothic lolita fashion; delicate lace, perfect bows, and beautiful roses.

### Likes/Hobbies/Talents

Celestius enjoys lavish parties, old cinema, hot tea, and true crime. She believes herself a scholar of Bellmoral and Mainland history.

### Bio

Proceed with caution.

Celestius' job is to report suspicious, deviant, and rule breaking behavior. Anything you say could trigger a trap. Though Celestius wears a lethargic stare in daily life, her face lights up when she stumbles upon the opportunity to make someone submit to her. Celestius doesn't report all behavior. In fact, Celestius doesn't care who does and doesn't break the rules from a moral standpoint. However, she does pay attention to who breaks what, and will use her knowledge as blackmail. This blackmail can range from petty favors to bigger asks in exchange for keeping her mouth zipped. Celestius will also snitch if she wants to see someone specific suffer at her hands. She favors both psychological and physical anguish from her victims, but usually utilizes mind tricks on others for her own pleasure in daily life. Physical torture is something more special. Celestius is calculated and only strikes when she's certain she can get away with it unscathed.

Slowly wearing your resolve, Celestius is a sprawling, mounting horror—a leering pair of eyes that never closes. Always observing. She is poised and sits up straight. Her voice is gentle but cloying, as if it's trying to unearth your psyche; almost hypnotic. Voicing a sharp native Mainlander accent, Celestius slots with the rich upper-classmen of Erigo. Her cruel sarcasm stings with humorless disregard.

Celestius is a hackney philosopher, espousing her sadism as the next rung to human enlightenment—worshiping death, waxing poetic about decay and rot for eons. Celestius fancies herself nobility—owed luxury, opulence, and wealth.

Celestius cares for ego and leisure at the expense of basic morality. Wielding empathy like a sword, her keen insight into human emotionality heightens her brutal comportment. Celestius enjoys the world the way it is, fully complacent in its ebbing cycles of abuse. Reaping and wringing the benefits from her surroundings, Celestius allows tragic events to unfold how they please.

**Daily Life**

Celestius is usually seen writing or documenting events in her group. She interviews group members on a monthly basis for signs of rebellion and "mental rot". To the others in the group, she's an outsider, her status as a Mainlander only bolstering their hostility. The group members avoid engaging Celestius, dreading her very presence in their space.

A high-class girl stuck in a colony-turned-tourist-trap, Celestius bores easily and cultivates her own entertainment. Celestius is indolent, using her position to manipulate others into doing her bidding.

Also, she murders innocent humans for fun when the urge rises. #Feminism.

**Fighting Technique**

Celestius is not an infantry operative; she joins the rare battle when requested. Cherishing her long black trident, Celestius wields it confidently in battle. She's not strong or skilled, but projects a bold front that can perplex an unsuspecting enemy.
