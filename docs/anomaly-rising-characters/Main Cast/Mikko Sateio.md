### Summary

Mikko Sateio is a Wakanean anomalous human working in Judicia as an anomaly operative trainee. She is kind and sympathetic, but harbors unaddressed trauma and anger due to societal pressures and past abuse. Searching for happiness, Mikko edits her own character and morality in a fruitless attempt to achieve sustainable joy. Mikko's black and white mentality lands her in hot water and tears her precious relationships apart.

### General Appearance

Mikko's black hair falls above her shoulders, the sharp shaggy ends curling upwards. Both her skin and eyes are dark brown. An aqua ring surrounds her pupil, and her iris turns aqua when she uses energy. Freckles dust Mikko's broad nose and full cheeks. Her pear-shaped body is sturdy, with much of her muscle in her legs and arms. Unpredictable clothing is one of her many passions, ranging from over-the-top and extravagant to muted and demure depending on her mood—with nail colors to match. Later in the story, her left eye is torn from its socket, and permanent bumpy scarring hides behind her wide array of colorful eye patches.

### Likes/Hobbies/Talents

Mikko plays multiple instruments—none of which she's mastered. She loves arcade games, weird fashion, eating comfort food, mechanical keyboards, drawing, frogs, and getting down and dirty with nature.

### Bio

Mikko is as spunky as she is bright. Some don't know what to make of her at first, writing her off as an eccentric oddball, only to warm up to her quirks in time.  With an expansive stockpile of interests, Mikko will chatter for hours if given a platform. In her mind floats a million frog facts, arcade trivia, and mechanical keyboard knowledge. Mikko defuses adversity with comedy and jovial distractions.

She is excitable and spontaneous, but retains maturity. Mikko's imposed social responsibility in adolescence informs her current habits. Fearing social isolation, to overcompensate for perceived shortcomings, Mikko nabs attention with her constructed fun-loving persona.

Everyone else's burdens are Mikko's burdens. Evading personal emotional obstacles, Mikko shoulders her friends' hurt to avoid tackling her own. Mikko internalizes her worries and feelings, ailing herself with migraines and stomach pain. Mikko expresses shallow anger, never allowing the depths of her rage to show. Her emotions pile up, hiding her baggage of them in fear of being judged.

Mikko groups people and things into boxes. Black and white—absolute evil and absolute good. None dwell in the middle, and she shoves them into one of the two categories to avoid distress. Mikko can rapidly switch the categories she assigns individuals or groups. When she sees you as good, you're her idol, flawless and beyond wrongdoing. Mikko sees the best in those she trusts, and holds naive, shallow perceptions of their character. If she deems you evil, no action can restore honor, and you are scum. Though Mikko internally justifies her dramatically shifting perspectives, her moral alignment changes on a whim.

She would move heaven and earth to be permanently happy. Everything she does is an attempt to attain the joy others around her have. Mikko goes under dramatic, whiplash-inducing changes to try to achieve this. This includes clothing, morals, goals, attitude, and general disposition. She will often copy a friend, a celebrity, or anyone else she admires, and “borrow” their aesthetics and personality. This is only temporarily satisfying. It distresses her when the changes no longer work, so she switches to other ones. Though certain qualities remain fixed, Mikko's identity fluctuates, morphing and adjusting at the drop of a hat.

To Mikko, attention and approval is survival.

Mikko craves notoriety through heroism, volunteering for dangerous operations in hopes of being noticed and of fulfilling a deep moral obligation. Her altruism is equal parts selfish and selfless.

### Daily Life

Mikko trains beyond her capacity, pushing against her own limits and honing her skills. Operative life is strange and foreign to Mikko, who questions her new surroundings and daily conundrums with insatiable curiosity. Mikko thrives in friendships of mutual admiration, and values her partnerships with fellow group mates.

She's frequently found at the arcade, mesmerized by rhythm and guitar games. In addition, she likes to explore rivers and lakes and search for wildlife, especially frogs. Animals trail behind Mikko like metal filings to a magnet, enraptured by her aura. Bugs, birds, dogs — all reciprocate Mikko's abounding curiosity. Stationery and craft stores are a favorite money sink of Mikko's. Her favorite hobby, though, is her burgeoning curation of odd clothing.

### Fighting Technique

Mikko approaches battle with a diverse array of techniques and disciplines. Whatever an enemy throws her way, Mikko adapts to and conquers. Above all, Mikko isn't above a kick to the crotch.
