# Community Interactions With PAS and WLF

### PAS and Easton

The PAS stands in an odd position with the community they're committed to serve. In Judicia, they are seen as protectors of the province by some, and an extension of Paradiso's secretive and dubious nature by others. While anomaly operatives are paid by the government to protect the public, they are not mistaken for police officers by any citizens. They wear much different uniforms and take on much different roles from the police. Rumors of operatives not being quite human are commonly discussed and spread. Most citizens know better than to mess with an operative; it could be the last thing they do.

Operatives are not called upon for riots or other public disturbances, as it is important to keep their work out of the public eye. Operative groups attend community fundraisers and events for strictly PR reasons, but are advised to keep a distance from the general population and avoid topics related to their work.

Each citizen in Judicia has the ability to report any disturbance including those that could be supernatural, whether through their phone, smartwatch, other electronic device, or a public digital reporting station found in each city. Residents are encouraged to report any interferences that defy logic, and to flee the area.

If a citizen has witnessed a disturbance, they are later visited and questioned by PAS employees. They conduct an interview to determine how much the individual has seen, and if they need to have their memory wiped.

The PAS does everything it can to distance Judicia citizens from demons and keep them ignorant of potential dangers to keep stress levels low.

Different provinces have different protocol for their respective PAS sector. In Rembridge (a province south of Judicia), they operate with their own guidelines. Rembridge operatives are required to chase down any demon they find and execute them; meanwhile, Judicia's operatives are more concerned with chasing them out of public spaces and keeping them from the view of the average citizen. Rembridge is far more aggressive to demons due to their burgeoning numbers. If a person is suspected of housing or being a demon, they could be executed on sight.

Citizens of Rembridge generally dislike PAS and the operatives, as they handle the poor far different from the rich. The operatives in Rembridge also tend to be white. The Wakanean operatives in Rembridge are mostly non-Hoabi.

### WLF and Easton

While the PAS is far less altruistic than the WLF, the WLF itself is far from perfect. In some instances, they have resorted to bargaining with the lives of citizens, or using citizens as a shield. WLF's rebellion results in many disturbance reports, so the public associates them with chaos and violence. Some employees of WLF disguise themselves as operatives, which worsens PAS's reputation when they misbehave. In addition, the WLF's higher ups are motivated by money opportunities and have a vested interest in liberation because of trade.

Citizens of Easton know of the WLF, and their opinions are diverse with negative, positive, neutral, and everything messy in between.
