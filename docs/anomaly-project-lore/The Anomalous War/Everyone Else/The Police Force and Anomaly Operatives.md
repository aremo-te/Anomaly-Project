# The Police Force and Anomaly Operatives

Every police force in Paradiso includes a temporary anomaly operative.

The operative is added to the force for any supernatural situation that could occur with the police patrol. They defend and protect the police from harm from demons or spirits.

Operatives in Parafora are notoriously obstructive for police. Operatives are cycled through for a shift with the police, and almost unanimously, they dread the mere concept. The police don't get along well with Parafora operatives. Police forces in all of Paradiso are primarily white men, while operative groups in Parafora consist primarily of people of color and other minorities the police instigates conflict with. These operatives often disobey orders or even actively sabotage police operations in ways they can get away with.

Despite an operative's abilities, the police force in Parafora is seen as far less expendable.
