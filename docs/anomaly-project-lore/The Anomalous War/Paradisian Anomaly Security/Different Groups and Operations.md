# Different Groups and Operations

The most common group for PAS is an operative group. Other groups are smaller in numbers, but are just as important.

Training groups are becoming a relic of the past. There's still some left, but a majority are in Mainland. These groups take in anomalous humans who've undergone gnosis and train them to become fully-fledged operatives. Most of these groups prioritize training for the infantry positions over medic positions.

Outside of operatives groups exist PAS institutes where research and experiments are conducted with energy. Some groups and experimental institutes have overlap where operatives participate in clinical trials or research. In a handful of groups like this, psychological tests for raising operatives from a young age were performed. They used newborns from artificial wombs or kidnapped infants and children. These practices have been phased out, but some suspect they've only become more secretive.
