# Magic Supression (AKA: Unauthorized Energy)

To the modern person, magic is old, distant, and arcane. Their ancestors probably dabbled in magic, maybe did some incredible things with it, but that's in the past. Many embrace the concept that the only reality is what is present and physical, and consider magic a relic of history (which itself is often not properly recognized). Most average people have never seen real magic performed before.

Magic is a chaotic and potentially dangerous source of power for any society or individual. While some societies embrace magic for its troubles and benefits, others prefer to control magic use. Paradiso, for example, has an iron grip on magical practice throughout their macro-nation. Magic (or energy, as they refer to it as) is only to be practiced by authorized individuals. Anyone seen or suspected of practicing magic should be immediately reported.

In prefectures with highly active demon populations, such as Judicia, citizens are encouraged to report anything suspicious related to the supernatural. Only those in the middle and upper class prefectures in Paradiso have access to these reporting methods. All electronic communication devices sold there include a function to immediately send a report. Most reports are of demon sightings, but a portion are of seeing another human use magic in the public eye. Those who are caught using magic are immediately apprehended and sent into [re-education](/docs/anomaly-project-lore/the-anomalous-war/paradisian-anomaly-security/operative-re-education).

In addition, books and education on magic are either banned or kept as distant historical documents. This discourages citizens from seeking out magical enlightenment.
