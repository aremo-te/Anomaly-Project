# The Common AO Energy Practices

All infantry trainees study from the same set of tools to begin practicing energy. Each trainee receives a set of digital/physical books and video lectures to study. For AOs, energy is a narrow and strict practice. There is no room for whimsy or creativity, only for straight-forward battle tactics. Each AO must hone their mind and their craft, and use their power with personal responsibility.

AOs are taught that their successes and failures are their own responsibility; if you make a mistake, you might not be saved. If you fail to educate yourself on the approved conventions for operatives, you take the blame for your downfall. The guidelines an operative learns preaches self-accountability as much as any energy principles.

An operative customizes their mode of combat to some degree. Some prefer defense to offense, raw energy to weapons, long-range to short-range fighting, etc. The most customizable aspect of the operative's disciplines is their choice of weapon. All operatives are required to have two weapons; one of which must be a standard black pistol for use in public. The other weapon can any you imagine, but there are suggestions for how you determine your choice. Your primary weapon should not be a projectile weapon; meaning things like guns, slingshots, bows, or any other weapon that tosses or throws an object. These weapons are better suited for later in a fight, because anomalies can easily dodge a bullet at even half their energy capacity. AO handbooks advise you to go with a weapon with a blade, long enough to create at least two feet of distance between you and your opponent.

Weapons are made with aggressive energy. To read more about energy types, please view this article [Spells and Practices](/docs/anomaly-project-lore/anomalies-and-magic/magic-and-energy/spells-and-practices).

An operative (or any physical anomaly, really) can have many weapons in their arsenal. Unfortunately, most operatives lack time to dedicate to creating more stable physically manifested objects.
