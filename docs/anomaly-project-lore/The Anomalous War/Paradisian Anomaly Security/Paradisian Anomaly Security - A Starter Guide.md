# Paradisian Anomaly Security: A Starter Guide

**Paradisian Anomaly Security**, also known as **PAS** for short, is a business-government conglomerate funded by investors and tax credits. PAS is an umbrella term for several organizations, but the most notable are the **anomaly operatives**; anomalous humans who neutralize supernatural threats. PAS is, as the title suggests, exclusive to Paradiso. Paradiso has a vested interest in keeping information about magic from their citizens.

PAS assists Paradiso with their two main goals: control of the budding demon population, and experimental research on the nature and possible applications of energy.

PAS is not a neutral organization. It exists to keep Paradisio's status quo intact. For that reason, many countries which oppose Paradiso also oppose PAS. A prime example of struggle between PAS and Paradiso's rivals is the handling of Easton.

Easton is a new and vulnerable region of Paradiso that relies on PAS to handle the uprising of demons. Nations surrounding Easton despise Paradiso's iron grip on trade and astronomical tariffs, courtesy of the recently acquired land. This, and internal dissension, led to the formation of the Wakanean Liberation Front-- also known as WLF. The WLF targets the PAS (specifically the operative groups) in an attempt to destabilize Easton's government.
