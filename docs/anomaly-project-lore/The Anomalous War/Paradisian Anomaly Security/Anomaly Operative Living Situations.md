# Anomaly Operative Living Situations

A solid 80% of anomaly operatives live in group quarters designed for them. Operative group bases are spread throughout Paradiso. Outsiders to PAS are not allowed to enter the base at any time.

Each group base has a loft/apartment complex, a shared mess hall with a kitchen, a gym, a boardroom, and separate housing for the captain (often above the boardroom). Some groups have extraneous rooms such as a mini-library, a common area for leisure activities, a sauna, etc. This all depends on the budget of the group's construction, as well as the location of the group. A group base in Mainland's groups are opulent compared to the mundane bases in Easton.

Not all operatives live in groups. A select few can petition to work off-site, usually from their own home. They report to a group for operations, but are able to live elsewhere. This is not very common, and is an extended process you can be rejected from for any reason.

Life as an AO is a lifetime gig; you cannot leave without consequence.
