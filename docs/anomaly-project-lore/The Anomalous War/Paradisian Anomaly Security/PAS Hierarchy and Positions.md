# PAS Hierarchy and Positions

## Operative Hierarchy

Operative groups have an internal hierarchy that organizes all members into groups. This is the hierarchy, ordered from highest to lowest in rank. Everyone listed here can be referred to as a **PAS Member**.

| Position | Description |
| --- | ------------ |
| `Captain` | The most stressful and highest rank in an operative group. A captain gives out commands, leads meetings, vetoes or approves final decisions, manages budget, and enforces group-specific rules they see fit. Captains are notorious for their legally dubious and rotten behavior. Notorious for their god complexes, far too many captains behave as if above consequence. A captain doesn't have to answer to anyone below them. *This position requires specialized training.*|
| `Reporter` | Reporters work in tandem with the captain as an equal, carrying a similar power. Reporters keep track of the behavior, compliance, and mental health of each group member. Said reports are given to the captain for further review. They conduct monthly interviews with members to review their training progress, group conduct, and deference to official group restrictions and regulations. A captain can give orders to a reporter, but cannot stop a reporter from reporting misconduct, including a captain's misconduct. Reporters aren't known for their battle prowess, but are called upon in a pinch when infantry requires extra hands. Instead of fighting demons, they're knee-deep in paperwork. A reporter's most important job is to stomp out rebel propaganda and to ensure no one in their group is a spy. *This position requires specialized training* |
| `Directors` | Directors create group schedules, bring complaints to the captain, and assist with paperwork. A director is directly below a captain. While captains technically get the last say, they need the director to assist them. Because of this, directors and captains argue often. Depending on the size of a group, there could be up to three directors. A director's orders are almost as powerful as a captain's. *This position requires specialized training.* |
| `Medics` | Medics are crucial to any group, which is why they are higher on the hierarchy. It takes far longer to train as a medic than to train as a member of the group's infantry. Training requires studying several textbooks to completion, as well as hands-on training under an experienced medic. The medic's job is to heal the wounds and ailments of an injured group member. In addition, a medic must be prepared to perform exorcisms and break curses and hexes. Medics are usually soft and have no battle prowess. In contrast, some infantry later become medics if it is a better fit for them. Medics are unsung heroes. While some mock the position or are rude to medics, it's generally best to respect them. *This position requires specialized training.* |
| `Trainers` | Trainers can hold the position of medic, director, captain, or infantry in addition to their trainer status. They are in charge of instructing and supervising trainees. This position grants authorial power over trainees. |
| `Coordinators` | The coordinator organizes time, places, and budget for group bonding activities. In addition, the coordinator stocks the main fridge and replaces appliances. The coordinator is a position in addition to infantry and medic. Coordinators do not hold a position of power, and are rather put-upon. |
| `Infantry` | The core of an operative group. Infantry neutralizes supernatural threats, exorcises spirits from buildings, and follows the orders of anyone above them. Everyone in the infantry has completed their operative training. Infantry and trainees are seen as the most expendable of any group. |
| `Trainees` | While there used to be many training groups in the past, budgeting forces trainees to join AO groups directly. A trainee studies and trains for the infantry or the medics. |


Different groups have different requirements. Depending on group size, a group might contain multiple reporters, directors, coordinators, and medics. Group #113, for example, is a rather small group in comparison to the average doubled head count.

 
## Regional Board Hierarchy

All captains must participate in the regional board. There are bi-monthly meetings reviewing the activity and progress of every aspect of PAS.


| Position | Description |
| --- | ------------ |
| `PAS Investors` | PAS investors are the rich organizational representatives or wealthy individuals with money invested in PAS. While they're technically not in charge, their demands are law. Money talks, after all.|
| `PAS Consulters` | PAS consulters are part of the review board who makes final decisions on changes to PAS regulations and restrictions. Consulters decide if a group should be moved or shut down.|
| `PAS Financial Managers` | The PAS financial managers are in charge of PAS budgeting, including money for operative groups, trainee groups, research groups, and off-site operatives who don't live in groups. If a group, region, or province isn't falling in line, they can advise the consulters to cut funding and dismantle entire operations.|
| `Region Representatives` | Region representatives report on all groups within their region, which includes all provinces. They can give direct orders to province representatives and captains.|
| `Province Representatives` | Province representatives report on all groups within their province. On the rare occasion of under-staffing, a captain in the province is also a province representative.|
| `Captains` | Captains are included on the board, but are the lowest of the hierarchy. Their reporter attends with them, and give a detailed review of group budget and performance. Captains are the least respected official board members here, and often get put on the spot.|
| `Others` | A category for everyone else included in these board meetings, such as group reporters, the head of a science department, etc. |

## Other Positions

Here are some positions and careers within PAS that exist outside boards and operative groups.

| Position | Description |
| --- | ------------ |
| `Interrogator` | The interrogator role is relevant to captured rebels (ILF/WLF members) and any other individual withholding useful information. The interrogator uses their conversation skills and psychological prowess, manipulating their target into divulging information, to elicit an emotional response, or even simply to get a read on their character. They also play an important role in criminal investigation related to PAS affairs. Whatever the case may be, the interrogator is noteworthy for their strategic thought process, their habit of profiling everyone around them, and their social and analytical abilities. *This position requires specialized training.*|
| `Researcher` | Researchers are hired to study and catalog energy, and their goal is to gain enough of an understanding of it, so they could harness it in such a way that benefits Paradiso. Due to energy being elusive by nature, these efforts are often met with stalemate and frustration. Researchers are discouraged from submitting information that is detrimental to Paradiso. |
