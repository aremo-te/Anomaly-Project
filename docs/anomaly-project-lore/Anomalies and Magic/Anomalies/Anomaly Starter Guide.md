# Anomalies: A Starter Guide

All anomalies are based on humanity. Though some speculate as to the existence of anomalous flora, fauna, and other non-human entities, none are confirmed to exist beyond ancient accounts of folklore. (Some of Wakaneâ€™s elders believe anomalies outside human alignment are rare due to technological growth, deforestation, and a reduced magical belief in the general populace. More rigorous research is needed to confirm any of these claims.)

An anomaly is born neither good nor bad, but is a neutral being that varies on an individual basis. Most anomalies react to their circumstance. An anomaly who is called a monster and believes itself to be a monster will turn into a monster.

All anomalies can be placed in two separate groups; corporeal and non-corporeal. Corporeal anomalies have a physical body, and their default form (without shape-shifting magic) closely resembles a human. Non-corporeal anomalies are ghosts that do not have a physical body. All anomalies have an awoken soul.
