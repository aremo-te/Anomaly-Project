# Special Abilities and Learning Beyond Your Capacity

Magic users use spells that extend beyond human limits. Each magic user will find they have an ability innate to them. This innate power is known as a **special ability**. A special ability is a handful of similar spells that users can perform without learning.

The special ability, like your aura, is tied to an aspect of your traits and core beliefs. For example, an anomaly who grew up valuing nature could have florakinesis.

Anomaly operatives who know many spells beyond their special ability are rare. This is not from a lack of diligence, but instead a widespread misconception: the perpetual fib that the only spells an energy user possesses is their special ability (outside of battle magic). This keeps operatives from studying and asking questions. Studying stimulates critical thinking, which does not benefit Paradiso. The priority is effective battle techniques; nothing else. Operatives are discouraged from doing research beyond the given materials and study guides.

Another perpetrated lie is that energy users have a limited spell capacity. The idea that you cannot learn beyond your limits is a common sentiment in AO groups. The concept of "special abilities" implies the only spells one can know outside operative textbooks is what is innate to them.

If a user wanted to learn to use more spells, they would have to study and work hard at each one in order to use it effectively. However, if the user is vaults hurdle, they theoretically could learn an infinite amount of spells.
