# Sent Away: What Paradiso Does With Misfit Citizens

In Paradiso, there exists a stigma around mental and physical health that fosters hostility throughout and beyond Mainland, its grip barely looser outside of it. Words like "depression" and "disability" are often punchlines to the general populace and to Paradiso's social services at large. The suicide rate in Parafora (parts of Paradiso that were conquered or taken, often considered outside the more elite parts of Paradiso; a highly racialized word) is more than two times that of Mainland and other parts of Paradiso.

Paradiso doesn't treat all of its land equally, and its people suffer for it. Parafora citizens are of lesser value, and therefore, have less access to health resources.

If a citizen is institutionalized for mental illness, there is a large chance that they will never be seen by the public again. Institutionalized citizens are sent to re-education facilities, and a sizable portion of them are recruited to become anomaly operatives. Each individual is analyzed to see if they're fit for operative work. This is considered along with the demand for new operatives, as well as the individual's importance to the community.

Paradiso offers many fixes for physical disabilities, but very few of them are perfect. There is no international healthcare, and citizens in Parafora often can't afford the same incredible advances in science that others in Paradiso can. Most provinces offer little support for its disabled citizens, and they have to rely on their friends and family to survive.

Paradiso's overall stance on gay people and trans people aren't clear. While neither are criminalized, there is no support for LGBT members within the law, and they are targeted individuals. Most politicians would not condemn them outright to maintain a good image, but legislation often proves their real thoughts and motivations.

In Easton, the gender-neutral language and trans-positive outlook left by Wakane is slowly being eradicated over time. While remaining positive values are strong enough to effect how Judicia works (ex: there are trans specialist doctors in Wexan), these changes are prominent.
