# Parafora

### Parafora: who is and isn't included

Parafora is a slang term used for lands conquered by Paradiso. Mind you, not all lands that integrate into Paradiso are what others call "Parafora". There are no "official" guidelines for what is and what isn't considered Parafora, but the way people use it explains much of its true meaning.

The word describes countries of so-called "lesser" value acquired by Paradiso. This perceived lesser value is often for xenophobic or racist reasons. Bellmoral, a country that integrated into Paradiso 400 years ago, is not considered Parafora. The citizens of Bellmoral are primarily white, and Bellmoral worships Paradiso's imperialist, aristocratic, and royal history. Unlike regions considered Parafora, Bellmoral kept its name.

If a country is called Parafora, it's often with a sneer or comedic disgust. Though it is part of Paradiso, it is not equal to the riches and influence of the more popular regions like Mainland.
