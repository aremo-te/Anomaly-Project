# Prefecture: Rembridge

**Rembridge** is Paradiso's southernmost prefecture in Easton. It is separated from Judicia by a tall gate. The border is known for its strict policies and entrance fees. People wishing to get from Rembridge to Judicia need a work visa. These work visas strictly forbid unauthorized overnight stay. To move residence to Judicia from Rembridge, they must show proof of income and have an approved housing unit they intend to occupy. The wall—as it is often referred to—is both a literal and metaphorical gate for income inequality in Easton.

Rembridge contains a higher concentration of Hoabi people compared to Judicia. This part of Easton is known for poor air quality, cutthroat law enforcement, lack of public transportation, factories, and poverty. The air quality here is so awful, there is an event each summer in which wind sweeps the pollution from Rembridge to Judicia in clouds of nauseous gas and smoke. The sky turns orange-red, and for two months, Judicia sees the sun blotted out from the sky.

No one in Rembridge wants to be there. Everyone speaks to each other of plans to leave, either to South Wakane or to Judicia. The promises of opportunity made by the job market of Judicia keeps residents in the hellish landscape; they endure these brutal conditions all for the sliver of a chance at a better life. Their schools, their infrastructure, and their public health systems are all woefully underfunded. A large portion of the population are displaced from Easton after Paradiso moved in, and do not consider it an ancestral home.
More of Wakane's culture thrives here than in Judicia, with its language and history. Nonetheless, it's being stamped out by Paradiso's impact on the continent.
