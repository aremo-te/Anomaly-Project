# Prefecture: Judicia

**Judicia** is a prefecture of Paradiso, and is among one of the recent additions to Paradiso in the last fifty years. This prefecture houses middle- and upper-class citizens. Judicia is gated off at its southern border from the Paradisian prefecture below called Rembridge. The high guarded walls keep anyone from leaving or entering without a permit.

A resident of Rembridge can move to Judicia if they meet the vast amount of criteria. Proof of employment in Judicia, proof of Judicia rental agreement or mortgage, and proof of income are all needed in order to change their permanent residence. The wall is both literally and symbolically gate-keeping resources from the lower class.

Judicia occupies what was once considered the Hoabi's land. The Hoabi, who are considered less racially desirable individuals by Paradiso, were displaced as a majority. Paradiso stoked the flames of bigotry already present between Hoabi Wakaneans and non-Hoabi Wakaneans. Paradiso encouraged non-Hoabi Wakaneans to move north to Judicia, with promises of opulent careers. Judicia's population is less than 20% Hoabi. Before displacement, Hoabi were about 70% of the population.
