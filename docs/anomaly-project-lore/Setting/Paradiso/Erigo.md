# Erigo (Mainland)

**Erigo**, or as it is more commonly called, Mainland, is the region in which Paradiso originated and is now its center. Without Mainland, there would be no Paradiso. This region is a cultural marvel, as well as home to political superpowers and important corporate influencers. Mainland is polished and prim, just like its citizens. Buildings tower over all, and reach up to the clouds in the heavens. The population of Mainland is approximately 80% white.

The common fashion and commercial trends here are of indulgence and decadence. Their food is not just good, it is sprinkled in gold dust and served on a silver platter. Their fashion is not just glamorous, but is made of the most expensive materials money can buy. Even casual-wear is opulent and excessive. You might as well not leave your home if you don't look like you belong. Another common trend is to cake the face and body in white makeup, for reasons that should be obvious.

Parafora and other countries look at Mainland with awe in their eyes. It's spoken of like it's a fantasy wonderland, and not an actual place one can visit. Not only do the rich and important live there, but they seem to be more important because they live there. In contrast, some despise Mainland's wasteful habits and the fascist undertones in everything from its advertising to its legislation. There's only so much a polished granite countertop can hide.

Within the borders of Mainland is *Eden Bay*, Paradiso's capital district-city. In Eden Bay stands the famous Sanlow Church and House of Parliament.
