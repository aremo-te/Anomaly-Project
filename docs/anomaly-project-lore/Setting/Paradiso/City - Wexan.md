# City: Wexan

The city of Wexan is a master-planned city in northwest Easton. Originally developed by The Wexan Company, the city was built from the ground up to be a location for tourists, large corporate conglomerates, expensive education, and upper middle class and rich Paradisian citizens.

The urban city boasts a high speed train system connecting to other cities, and the railroad leads all the way down to South Wakane. Wexan contains several artificial lakes, several of which circle a sprawling university. The city contains two main parts, the wilderness and the business complex. A majority of housing consists of lofts and apartments. The urban setting contains very few single family houses. The further a citizen lives from the shore, the less expensive their living expenses are.

The city is still a work in progress. There are some areas gated off to the public to be unveiled later. Most of these are empty tourist attractions like theme parks and boardwalks. Union issues cause delays, and might keep these locations from ever being completed as intended.

The city consists of roughly 30,000 citizens. Of this population, 50% are non-Hoabi Wakanean, 20% are white, and the rest are divided into smaller racial pools.

The forest in the eastern portion of Wexan hides an operative group called Group #113 of Northwest Judicia.
