# Imperialism and Change

Prior to Paradisian interference, Wakane was a well-functioning society of its time, and pushing the boundaries in both science and influence. Its robust trade system and vast quantities of lithium and silver were a source of wealth and income for all of its society. Their militia and defense programs kept their country safe without diverting too much of its resources. It kept its nose clean and stayed out of modern wars. This all fell apart with the catastrophic Wihado Flood (calamitous/misfortune flood). After a hurricane tore through Wakane, houses and businesses were left in ruins. Miners who arrived at their job site found the caves flooded and overflown with water that damaged the electricity.

Wakane's economy crashed, and had little funding for national emergencies stowed away. Exports ceased overnight, and threw the country into an emergency crisis. Noticing the opportunity, Paradiso swept in. They offered Wakane money and resources to repair their country, and granted them loans. These loans included interest Wakane could never pay off, but amid the crisis, they had no choice.

Paradiso constructed colonies at first, and housed Paradisians who assisted in repairs and other volunteer/low-paid work. The colonies expanded over time, and became small Paradisian villages. The job market for Wakane shrank every day, which led Paradiso to make another offer. They would build their own schools, train workers, and establish locations for Paradisian national businesses in Wakane, as long as they decide how it all comes to fruition. This includes the curriculum, which among other things only taught Communia. Wakane agreed, and Paradiso began to expand.

Paradiso's influence spread like a plague through northern Wakane. Behind the scenes, Paradiso organized coups and civil unrest to destabilize the government. As Wakane sunk further and further into debt, they had no choice but to consider bankruptcy. Paradiso claimed northern Wakane and renamed it to Easton. At the time, Paradiso claimed to have forgiven the debt in exchange for the land, but in this current time, they have taken back their word. Paradiso is hard at work trying to destabilize what's left of Wakane and claim it for their own.
