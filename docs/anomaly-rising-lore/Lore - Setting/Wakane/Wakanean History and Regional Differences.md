# Wakanean History and Regional Differences

Wakane, as a country, has existed for roughly two thousand years. Four hundred of the documented years were spent in isolation from other countries, with their borders opened only for trade and labor.

Wakanean racial characteristics include monolids, light to medium brown skin tones, straight or wavy black hair, and medium statures. As with all racial groups, these are wide-sweeping observations, and are not true to each and every Wakanean individual.

Traditional Wakanean clothing is loose and allows for wide movement of all limbs. This clothing also includes large pockets. Hair is cut to or above the shoulders, as it suggests good and frequent grooming.

Wakane started a labor program in 1900 for refugees from Neriru, a nearby country whose people fled from their land when Paradiso invaded. They migrated to northern Wakane. The Neriru brought their own culture and practices with them to Wakane, and worked blue collar jobs in exchange for housing and means to survive. The relationship between the Neriru and Wakane has always been antagonistic, with the Neriru being a labor and racial underclass. Historical records speak of fights between the two groups in early days that resulted in multiple deaths.

The Neriru have dark skin, coarsely curled black hair, large rounded noses, and tall statures. The Hoabi, being a mix of both non-Neriru and Neriru Wakanean, share traits from both racial groups.

The national language of Wakane is Wakanele. Wakanele has its own syllabary and is known for its intricate and specific cultural norms with honorifics. Before Paradisian influence, both their society and language contain no differences or specifications in gender. Words for gender-specificity were taken from archaic Wakanele words when Paradiso joined their land.

Different regions of Wakane speak their own dialects. The Hoabi have two documented dialects, but the average Hoabi person insists there are more. Of these dialects, one originates from the eastern portion of their northern land. This dialect, called Zoyida, replaces some consonant sounds. Zoyida is also traced back to Neriru migrants, who added parts of their language style to Wakanele. They use shortened names in most contexts, as they consider a full name to be far too intimate or serious for daily discussion. A full name can denote a life or death situation, expression of hatred, or a declaration of love, depending on the context.

The Neriru people integrated into the land they migrated to, and called it home after a few generations grew up there. They mixed with the surrounding population of Wakaneans over time, and their children were called Hoabi, meaning "northern family"
