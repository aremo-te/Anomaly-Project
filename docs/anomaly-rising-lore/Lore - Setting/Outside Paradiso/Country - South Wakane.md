# Country - South Wakane

**South Wakane** is a country below Easton in the continent of Kutonia. South Wakane is surrounded by water on the south, east, and west sides. South Wakane previously belonged to the whole of Wakane. The nation of Wakane contained the eastern and southern portion of Kutonia before Paradisian colonization. South Wakane is all that is left of Wakane.

In recent decades, the South Wakane economy has recovered due to an explosion of trade with outside countries. The current leaders of South Wakane are on unfriendly terms with Easton (and Paradiso in general), and bottleneck trade between the nations. South Wakane and Easton are connected by a railroad running between them. This is a relic of the past relationship between the two nations, and Paradiso and parts of South Wakane's government body want to shut down any transit on that railroad. Many rely on it for job transportation, and would suffer if it ceased operation.

The residents of South Wakane primarily speak Communia, a fact that isn't a surprise considering Paradiso's influence on Kutonia as a whole. The second most common language is Wakanele, which contains several dialects depending on region. South Wakane contains the highest percentage of the Hoabi population in all Kutonia. Most Hoabi who live there have been displaced from Easton when their homes were torn down.

South Wakane's prosperity varies depending on location. Some areas are recovering from the economic crash well, and include public transportation, polished infrastructure, and support systems. While the government is pushing these programs to the needier parts of South Wakane, it's clear some parts of South Wakane aren't recovering as fast. The fluctuation of Wakaneans escaping from Paradisian rule from Easton caused a schism between those who lived there and those who moved in.
