# How Paradiso Steals Land and Destroys Cultures

Paradiso earned an infamous reputation for cultural erasure and appropriation over the course of its existence. Paradiso accounts for a quarter of all land on the planet--not including the oceans in their territory. As an international superpower and macro country with regions that stretch across the earth, Paradiso causes massive changes that ripple through the other countries.

Paradiso has a variety of tools at their arsenal to conquer the surrounding land, and many of their attempts to absorb land into their nation have been successful. Among their many tactics are supporting coups, adding colonies to foreign lands, and offering emergency services to cloak their influence in a guise of humanitarianism. In the past thousand years, Paradiso was one of the more violent nations that took lives and pillaged nations. Over time, Paradiso grew past its bloody and genocidal history, and now prefers more indirect and surreptitious strategies.

The language and culture of Paradiso is not only a great pride of the country, but is the envy of many other countries as well. Paradiso's wealth, control, and grandiosity captures the eyes of millions. Communia, Paradiso's official language, is taught in schools and institutions across the globe. The fashion capital, the political domineer, the cultural center point; Paradiso is your future, even if you don't live there.

When Paradiso marches into a country (whether to raid, colonize or "assist"), it digs its own roots in and rips out the original country's roots to carelessly toss away. While the process is slow and takes course over decades, it results in another country's native population integrating culturally with Paradiso. Paradiso continues to devour many of the native languages and cultural practices of the countries it takes and is in the process of taking. Native residents, even if they come from a family of natives, sometimes have no knowledge of their history and culture that's been filed away and replaced.
