# Magic / Energy - A Starter Guide

The difference between the terms “magic" and "energy” is linguistic, and does not correlate to two different concepts in practice. Both magic and energy describe life force all living beings contain and rely on. A being without energy is dead.

The true nature of energy is illusive and cannot be fully understood. It can be manipulated and cultivated, never conquered.

Though a human uses much less energy than an anomaly, they require energy sustenance for life, and all living beings use energy daily. Intense emotions can also drain one of their energy. Though humans are blocked from their true energy potential, they can use small amounts of energy. For human magic users, it’s common to use magic in groups to strengthen its power.

Energy is linked to self-determination and the power of the will. Energy is used for spells, hexes, physical manifestation, alchemy, healing, and a vast amount of other practices.
