# Physical Manifestation

**Physical manifestation** (also called **summoning**) using energy is one of the most common practices. While some consider it a spell, its properties are unique. Most forms of energy are invisible, fade away immediately, or pass through/around solid bodies. Objects manifested with energy are different, as they are indistinguishable from regular objects.

Like all other energy practices, visualization skills are essential. If you cannot visualize what you want to materialize, it will not appear. Physical manifestation is an involved practice which requires time, energy, and intense focus in order to master. The goal is to manifest an object in the blink of an eye without hassle. When you manifest properly, the object forms as a glowing mass of energy, then solidifies to the desired object.

Manifesting is a prolonged process, especially if you are new to it. It can take weeks or even months to properly manifest an object without it disappearing into thin air. It is a personal journey; for some it can take a long time to learn, while it is second nature for others.

The object can be anything inanimate object within reasonable size, and can replicate any texture. The more detail, the more practice it takes to manifest properly.

The average AO utilizes physical manifestation daily for weapons and shields. Any AO worth their salt can summon their weapon and fight without having to dwell on it.
