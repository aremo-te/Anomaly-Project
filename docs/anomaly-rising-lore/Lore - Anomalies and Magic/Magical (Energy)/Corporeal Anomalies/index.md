# Corporeal Anomalies

## Shared traits of corporeal anomalies

A well-fed corporeal anomaly carries more energy than a human, which grants them other abilities. When properly nourished, they outweigh a human in terms of strength (e.g., a human anomaly can bend steel with their pinky, can lift a car, etc.), and are immune to disease, human illnesses, and poisons. With the feeding prerequisite fulfilled, physical weapons (weapons not made out of energy) cannot harm a human anomaly; this includes guns, knives, and heavy objects. They cannot be damaged by a fall, no matter the height.

All corporeal anomalies have the ability to eat and digest real food. Whether they can persist solely on that depends on their type. When starved, all corporeal anomalies crave the best source of energy; flesh. Even the most distinguished anomaly, when starved, will lash out and try to eat whatever energy-rich food source is near them. This is the unavoidable fate of all corporeal anomalies, and one of many drawbacks.

The power of a corporeal anomaly, in terms of magic and other abilities given to them, is comparable to how much energy they have within them. Though skill is the major factor in a battle, the amount of energy an anomaly has can be the difference between life and death.

All corporeal anomalies are injured and can be killed by the following: lack of oxygen, energy-based weapons, spells/curses (harmful energy use in general), blood loss, the physical power of another anomaly, starvation, dehydration, and drowning. An anomalous human can heal from traumatic and egregious bodily harm, though the mortality rate goes down when they have another anomaly heal them. While a new life as an anomaly grants upsides, awakening (on its own) cannot "cure" physical and psychological disabilities that are not linked to disease.

Corporeal anomalies can use spells, curses, and all other sorts of magical work.

Corporeal anomalies starve fast. They need much more sustenance than humans, and the more energy-potent, the better. A human can survive without food and water longer than a corporeal anomaly; the corporeal anomaly burns their energy quick by simply existing.  A starving corporeal anomaly is a weak one. They can go a maximum of three days without sustenance. A corporeal anomaly who eats as much as a human carries the same amount of energy, and is susceptible to human ailments (such as illness mentioned earlier).
