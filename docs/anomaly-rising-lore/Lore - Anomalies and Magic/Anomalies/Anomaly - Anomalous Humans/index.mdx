# Anomaly - Anomalous Humans

## Not quite human; not quite a spirit; not quite a demon; a love letter to the anomalous humans that patrol our cities, and a curse to those aligned against our beloved <span style={{color: 'red'}}>red moon</span>.

### The anomalous human's legacy

An anomalous human (also referred to as a human anomaly) is an anomaly with a physical human body. Anomalous humans, unlike the other two anomalies, are made with intent. One could become a demon or a ghost without intending to. In contrast, you can only become a human anomaly on purpose. This is due to how an anomalous human is created.
Awakening

This process is referred to with many names; the most notable being awakening or gnosis. A human meditates until they unlock their soul, thus leaving behind normal human life. For some, the awakening process can take a year or more; for others, it's more natural. This depends on the personality of the individual. The journey into one's inner self is strenuous, and requires a vast amount of self-awareness and discipline in order to conquer. The human is confronted by dreadful audio-visual stimuli, as well as their worst fears. If one is distracted by the visions of their soul, or overwhelmed with the horror of staring one's true self in the face, the human will suffer a painful death. Awakening is dangerous, and this high-risk high-reward scenario leaves you with unlocked power, or as a corpse.

### Abilities, weaknesses, attributes

All humans can use energy to some extent, but are limited in potential. Meanwhile, an anomalous human can harness the energy in their body as well as in their surroundings, and manipulate it to their will. In addition, anomalous humans can cast spells and create new physical objects using their energy. *For more information on this concept, please view [Physical Manifestation](/docs/anomaly-rising-lore/lore-anomalies-and-magic/magical-energy/physical-manifestation)*.

A human anomaly's body closely resembles a human's (if they don't use spells to alter their appearance). The only difference in their form is the eyes, which are a tell-tale sign of the state of a soul. *For more information on this, please view [Souls and Eyes](/docs/anomaly-rising-lore/lore-anomalies-and-magic/magical-energy/souls-and-eyes).*

Anomalous humans must eat almost twice as much as the average human to be in good shape.

An anomalous human, as well as all anomalies and regular humans, can suffer from energy sickness and curses. *For more information on these concepts, please view [Spells and Practices](/docs/anomaly-rising-lore/lore-anomalies-and-magic/magical-energy/spells-and-practices)*.

Another weakness of the anomalous human is the changes it makes to the soul. If an anomalous human experiences too much emotional anguish, it causes the soul to distort. If this continues for long enough, their soul will develop a demonic growth. All mentally unstable anomalous humans are at risk of becoming demons if they don't exercise caution.

### An important distinction

Not every anomalous human is an anomaly operative. An anomaly operative (frequently shortened to just operative or AO) is an occupation. While every anomaly operative is an anomalous human, not every anomalous human is an anomaly operative. The two categories have overlap, but should not be confused with each other. *For more information about this distinction, please view [The Overlap](/docs/anomaly-rising-lore/lore-the-anomalous-war/the-overlap).*
