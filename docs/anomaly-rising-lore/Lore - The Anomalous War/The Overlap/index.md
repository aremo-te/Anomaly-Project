# The Overlap

### Where do you draw the boundary between anomaly operatives and anomalous humans?

In practice, all anomaly operatives are anomalous humans. There are no known cases of an anomaly operative who is not also an anomaly, as it is required of the job. Humans do not have the energetic capacity to contend with demons. A human can hide or live in an operative group, but that does not make them an operative.

However, not all anomalous humans in the world are anomaly operatives. The anomaly operative position is a career, not a type of spiritual alignment. Anomalous humans exist outside the anomaly operative occupation, and have for centuries. The paid anomaly operative position has only existed for 60 years. A few cultures include anomalous humans as part of their practices; but most are detached from spiritual and energetic practices.

Some anomalous humans are simply magic practitioners who unlocked their souls on their own. If you practice energy unauthorized in Paradiso, you will be apprehended by the authorities.

There are anomalous humans who work for Paradiso who aren't operatives, but function under PAS (Paradisian Anomaly Security). The jobs range from investigators to clinical research subjects. Paradisian Anomaly Security operates with as few anomalous human employees as they can get away with; even if re-education can change them, there's always a chance they could misbehave or rebel.

The WLF (Wakane Liberation Front) also contains many anomalous humans. The ratio of human to anomalous human is balanced when compared to operative groups, as some in the liberation front aren't involved in combat.

Not to say all anomalies in any association are anomalous humans; demons lurk in groups in the PAS and the WLF.
