# The Liberation Front: A Starter Guide

Some countries are displeased with Paradiso's status as a macro-nation. To many, Paradiso is pushing a fascist totalitarian agenda as they dominate international trade and absorb other countries to reap their resources. A few countries outside Paradiso have taken interest in expelling Paradiso from the lands it has bought or stolen in order to level the playing field. The countries willing to go the furthest have joined **The International Liberation Front** (ILF).

The ILF includes seventeen different countries, and consists of different sectors. The **Wakane Liberation Front** (WLF) is one sector focused on ridding Easton of Paradiso influence and returning it to Wakane. The Wakane Liberation Front specifically targets the PAS employees in Easton, due to PAS being considered the foundation keeping Paradiso afloat.

There are a variety of employees. Some WLF employees are ex-operatives who infiltrate groups as spies. Some operations track down and execute operative groups/employees, while other operations require agents to kidnap operatives. Another section of WLF are the cyber-defense employees and hackers who alter and steal online PAS data.

While every liberation front has a good cause in mind, not every individual of every sector has morally sound motivations. Some sectors are motivated by greed-- removing Paradisian influence will improve international trade relations. For example, the countries most interested in liberating Wakane work towards that goal because of Wakane's wealth of natural resources. Paradiso blocks the exchange of such resources; thus, ridding the land of Paradiso is the best way to re-establish trade.

Liberation practices aren't perfect, and there is internal and external criticism of their tactics. Each sector has its own goals, and no two function the same. The targeting of PAS members (specifically operatives) is specific to WLF.
