# WLF Agents

## Each liberation sector has their own roles for employees. The following agents are specific to the Wakane Liberation Front.

 
### Infiltrators

An **infiltrator** joins operative groups, disguised as a naive recruit. With help from WLF technicians, their information is added or changed within the servers to falsify data. This protects the true identity of the infiltrator.

What an infiltrator does depends on their operation and directive. A handful of instructions can include leaking confidential information, spying on operatives, disrupting missions, and executing group members.

Whether an infiltrator in a group kills demons is up to their morals. They are highly discouraged from murdering liberation agents they find on the field, even if they're in the eye of other operatives who expect the infiltrator to kill them. All members of this role are physical anomalies; the majority are anomalous humans with a smaller minority of demons.

 
### Technicians

**Technician** is a broad umbrella term for many types of employees. Technicians are server programmers, cyber-defense experts, and hackers. All these positions maintain the integrity and security of all digital transactions, emails, and confidential information. The tech side of WLF is by far the best funded, and they maintain dominance over PAS's notoriously leaky servers. The majority of technicians are humans.

 
### Counteraction Militia

**Counteraction militia** includes anyone who engages in combat for WLF. This includes raiding PAS associated buildings/groups, sabotaging missions, and kidnapping or executing PAS employees. All members of this role are physical anomalies; the majority are anomalous humans and the minority demons. The counteraction militia can live near the border of Easton, or in a group hidden inside Easton.

 
### Counteraction Spies

**Counteraction Spies** are agents who engage in lethal and non-lethal operations. They deliver information, pass borders undetected, damage and bug government buildings, and recruit others within Easton. All members of this group are humans, or maintain a weak energy pattern in order to fit in with other humans. Their job is to blend in with the general population.
