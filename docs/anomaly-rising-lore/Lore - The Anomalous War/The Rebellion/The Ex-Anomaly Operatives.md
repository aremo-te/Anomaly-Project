# The Ex-Anomaly Operatives

Anomaly operatives are notorious for their obedience and loyalty to their cause, but what happens when one defects?

Everything an operative experiences will shape who they are. Each aspect of groups, re-education, and recruitment is meant to mold them into the perfect operative. An operative who rebels is one who bypassed all the barriers to their insurrection. The (literal) hypnotic power captains hold, along with the promise of harsh punishment for rebellion, is enough to tame even the most defiant person. The pressure to remain complacent holds the operative down and glues them in place.

A majority of anomaly operatives don't live long enough to retire. They die in battle, and they die young.

So, how does one fight against a system set up to keep you deferential? It begins inside.

An operative who dwells on their re-education is impaired with excruciating migraines. If you attempt to self-deprogram, you enter a world of indescribable anguish. It is tough work to uncover blocked memories, and could take weeks of consistent attempts to unravel the mysteries of your past. Deprogramming can lead you to loathe your position and past abuse, and gain a sense of clarity. While the urge to escape can overwhelm a person, lingering effects of re-education can linger and hold an operative captive.

Anyone who decides to escape has overcome their deepest fears, and is gallant for their self-awareness and sense of autonomy.

From there, the operative has a few choices. They can find a way to flee Paradiso and start a new life, or join a liberation front if one is available. Liberation fronts hide in groups across Paradiso, with the largest amount located in Easton. An ex-anomaly operative would be a crucial asset to the WLF sector in particular for their expertise on operative groups and battle/healing skills.
