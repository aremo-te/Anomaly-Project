# Operative Re-education

In order to join an operative group, an anomalous human needs to undergo re-education.

Re-education facilities exist both outside and within PAS. These facilities are akin to mental wards or asylums. They rely heavily on psychoactive or numbing drugs, hypnosis, and psychological manipulation tactics. The goal in all of these facilities is to break down the individual's psyche and retrain them for proper behavior and appropriate thought processes. Each re-education experience is custom tailored for each person, and designed for the fastest results.

For operative re-education, the thoughts they inject are specified for their position. An example of this is respect for captains and higher-ups. This information is drilled into their heads, and the thought of disobeying their captain or rebelling induces a fear response. Because of this re-education tactic, captains have the direct path to developing a swollen ego from their own brainwashing. An operative who's been through treatment will go into a hypnotized state when a captain delivers a direct order. The phrase includes keywords, such as "command", that awaken the state. Other situations can rouse the hypnotized state, such as a stern look from a captain, or a situation where they have been trained to behave/act a certain way.

Each patient takes a different amount of time to break. The process ranges from a few days to a month, depending on the resilience of the patient. When the patient leaves, they either cannot recall their treatment, or remember only incomprehensible bits.

The operative is taught to compulsively follow rules and instructions. How obedient they end up depends on the individual, but re-education has a high success rate. An operative's main job is to contain demons away from the population, as well as neutralize them. Therefore, the operative needs to remain an operative, and not succumb to the stress of becoming a demon. If an operative ends up becoming a demon, they are tortured with guilt and anguish. They feel the urge to either commit suicide or turn themself in and tell their captainâ€”a hard compulsion to resist.

No one is quite sure what happens to an AO who turns themself in, but all assume it isn't pleasant.
