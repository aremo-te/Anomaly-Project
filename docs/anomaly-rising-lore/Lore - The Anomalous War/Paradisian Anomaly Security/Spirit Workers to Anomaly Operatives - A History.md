# Spirit Workers to Anomaly Operatives: A History

Those who tend to spirits and exorcise demons have existed across history for hundreds—if not thousands—of years. There are as many specific practices as there are cultures that exist on Earth. Without Paradisian influence, many of these cultures would have retained their practices into the current century.

Before Paradiso, the spirit workers of Wakane kept any demon and spirit problem at bay without issue. They practiced in groups, usually of families, and lived in the society they had sworn to protect. The spirit workers were human anomalies who passed down their practices from generation to generation. They spread their philosophy and teachings through books and oral accounts.

At the time of Paradiso's first established Wakane colony, they were undergoing a massive problem with demon appearances in Parafora. The spirit workers of Wakane, unlike most other cultures', were involved directly with their own society, and not a secret to anyone. Paradiso watched as spirit workers pacified demons and took an interest. With their growing influence in Wakane, they funded these spirit workers and changed their policies. With enough time, groups were reestablished, along with reconsideration of a spirit worker's goals.

The new goal: get rid of demons at all cost.

While Wakane tradition required that demons be pacified or humanely put down as a last resort, Paradiso wanted demons gone. They did not consider demons as the unfortunate and needy members of Wakanaen society, but as vermin.

These goals and groups spread outside Wakane and eventually made it all the way to Mainland. Spirit workers still exist, though only in small pockets in South Wakane.

Demons are created by strife, stress, and trauma; an anomaly operative is a bandage on a cracked foundation. The operatives need an overhaul, but Easton's societal norms and government must be destroyed as well to truly resolve the influx of demon appearances.
