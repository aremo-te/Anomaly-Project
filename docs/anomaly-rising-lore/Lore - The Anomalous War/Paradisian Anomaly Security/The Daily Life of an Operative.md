# The Daily Life of an Operative

Daily activities of an operative depend on both their group's purpose and their position in said group.

The most common type of group is a field-work group, and the most common position is infantry. Their hours vary, but they commonly work 40-50 hours a week. An operative can work days in a row due to their abilities as an anomaly, and are sometimes scheduled for three consecutive eight-hour shifts (referred to as triples or triple shifts) when required to.

Infantry field work involves patrolling the town or city they are located in/closest to. If they encounter any demons, they are to execute them on sight. Other operations for infantry include exorcising specific buildings, infiltrating demon camps, and working with the police. A director could threaten an operative with a bad schedule if they don't behave, giving them "haunted house duty" or a police assistant shift, neither of which are savory for an operative. For more information on operatives and police work, please refer to [**The Police Force and Anomaly Operatives**](/docs/anomaly-rising-lore/lore-the-anomalous-war/everyone-else/the-police-force-and-anomaly-operatives).

Like any other anomaly, operatives have an insatiable appetite. They need to eat frequently to keep their energy reserves full. Much of their time is spent in the mess hall of their group. Communal cooking in the shared kitchen and group meals are when operatives chat and bond. Or argue.

While directors and captains participate in patrol, a sizable chunk of their time is spent in meetings, with paperwork, or planning an operation.

A common position in fieldwork groups is the medic. Medics aren't on the battlefield unless they're called in for extra help in desperate times. Medics spend most of their time tending to the wounds and ailments of the infantry. Sometimes, the infantry can't make it to the medics, who then need to rush out to find the infantry before they succumb to their injuries.
