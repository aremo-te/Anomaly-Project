## The Anomaly Project

In a world of virulent anomalies and the contentious affairs of state, annihilation is a gift worth giving. Bathe in the malignant glow of the red moon and bare your body for judgement.

*The Anomaly Project* is a multimedia amalgamation of storycraft and DIY worldbuilding, more than a decade in the works. 

The creator, Aremo_te, first envisioned the project in 6th grade while left alone on a swing set with little to occupy their thoughts. Now, twelve years later, *The Anomaly Project* is an extensive universe brimming with extensive lore and multi-faceted characters. Arriving soon, and at no cost to the viewer, *The Anomaly Project* will feature a webcomic, a novel, an original score, and even an RPG. If you are interested in keeping the project available for free, please consider supporting financially with a donation.
